0	one thing is for sure : this movie does not tell you a whole lot about lily chou-chou . 
0	with a tone as variable as the cinematography , schaeffer's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs , and the characters' quirks and foibles never jell into charm . 
0	to better understand why this didn't connect with me would require another viewing , and i won't be sitting through this one again . . . that in itself is commentary enough . 
0	cuba gooding jr . valiantly mugs his way through snow dogs , but even his boisterous energy fails to spark this leaden comedy .

0	storytelling feels slight . 
0	[swimfan] falls victim to sloppy plotting , an insultingly unbelievable final act and a villainess who is too crazy to be interesting . 
0	this remake of lina wertmuller's 1975 eroti-comedy might just be the biggest husband-and-wife disaster since john and bo derek made the ridiculous bolero . 
0	silly , loud and goofy . 
0	why spend $9 on the same stuff you can get for a buck or so in that greasy little vidgame pit in the theater lobby ? 
0	the french director has turned out nearly 21/2 hours of unfocused , excruciatingly tedious cinema that , half an hour in , starts making water torture seem appealing .

0	it's hard to imagine any recent film , independent or otherwise , that makes as much of a mess as this one . 
0	some of the computer animation is handsome , and various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale , but overall the film never rises above mediocrity . 
0	there's an excellent 90-minute film here ; unfortunately , it runs for 170 . 
0	as saccharine movies go , this is likely to cause massive cardiac arrest if taken in large doses . 
0	die another day is only intermittently entertaining but it's hard not to be a sucker for its charms , or perhaps it's just impossible not to feel nostalgia for movies you grew up with . 
0	as is often the case with ambitious , eager first-time filmmakers , mr . murray , a prolific director of music videos , stuffs his debut with more plot than it can comfortably hold . 
0	the mystery of enigma is how a rich historical subject , combined with so much first-rate talent . . . could have yielded such a flat , plodding picture . 
0	it throws quirky characters , odd situations , and off-kilter dialogue at us , all as if to say , " look at this ! this is an interesting movie ! " but the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging . 
0	the inherent limitations of using a video game as the source material movie are once again made all too clear in this schlocky horror/action hybrid . 
0	bad company . bad movie . just plain bad . 
0	it's not only dull because we've seen [eddie] murphy do the genial-rogue shtick to death , but because the plot is equally hackneyed . 
0	avary's film never quite emerges from the shadow of ellis' book . 
0	a poorly scripted , preachy fable that forgets about unfolding a coherent , believable story in its zeal to spread propaganda . 
0	while it is interesting to witness the conflict from the palestinian side , longley's film lacks balance . . . and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context . 
0	woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director , but how long will filmmakers copy the " saving private ryan " battle scenes before realizing steven spielberg got it right the first time ? 
0	it's sincere to a fault , but , unfortunately , not very compelling or much fun . 
0	 . . . jones , despite a definitely distinctive screen presence , just isn't able to muster for a movie that , its title notwithstanding , should have been a lot nastier if it wanted to fully capitalize on its lead's specific gifts . 
0	this follow-up seems so similar to the 1953 disney classic that it makes one long for a geriatric peter . 
0	why , you may ask , why should you buy the movie milk when the tv cow is free ? there's no good answer to that one . 
0	this slow-moving swedish film offers not even a hint of joy , preferring to focus on the humiliation of martin as he defecates in bed and urinates on the plants at his own birthday party . 
0	a muddled limp biscuit of a movie , a vampire soap opera that doesn't make much sense even on its own terms . 
0	there's the plot , and a maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score that made me want to scream .

0	this is amusing for about three minutes . 
0	klein , charming in comedies like american pie and dead-on in election , delivers one of the saddest action hero performances ever witnessed . 
0	it's rare to see a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from " promising " to " interesting " to " familiar " before landing squarely on " stupid " . 
0	this is the sort of low-grade dreck that usually goes straight to video --with a lousy script , inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography , complete with visible boom mikes . 
0	the direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence , but for most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why . 
0	there are few things more frustrating to a film buff than seeing an otherwise good movie marred beyond redemption by a disastrous ending . 
0	it won't harm anyone , but neither can i think of a very good reason to rush right out and see it . after all , it'll probably be in video stores by christmas , and it might just be better suited to a night in the living room than a night at the movies . 
0	looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights . 
0	given too much time to consider the looseness of the piece , the picture begins to resemble the shapeless , grasping actors' workshop that it is . 
0	they kept much of the plot but jettisoned the stuff that would make this a moving experience for people who haven't read the book . 
0	just because a walk to remember is shrewd enough to activate girlish tear ducts doesn't mean it's good enough for our girls . 
0	[carvey's] characters are both overplayed and exaggerated , but then again , subtlety has never been his trademark . 
0	it's mildly interesting to ponder the peculiar american style of justice that plays out here , but it's so muddled and derivative that few will bother thinking it all through . 
0	this dreadfully earnest inversion of the concubine love triangle eschews the previous film's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension . 
0	brown's saga , like many before his , makes for snappy prose but a stumblebum of a movie .

0	oedekerk mugs mercilessly , and the genuinely funny jokes are few and far between . 
0	since dahmer resorts to standard slasher flick thrills when it should be most in the mind of the killer , it misses a major opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche . 
0	only those most addicted to film violence in all its forms will find anything here to appreciate . 
0	cold and scattered , minority report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals . that's not vintage spielberg and that , finally , is minimally satisfying .

0	directed without the expected flair or imagination by hong kong master john woo , windtalkers airs just about every cliche in the war movie compendium across its indulgent two-hour-and-fifteen-minute length . 
0	it's a very tasteful rock and roll movie . you could put it on a coffee table anywhere . 
0	the movie is loaded with good intentions , but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the holocaust escape story , minac drains his movie of all individuality .

0	this film biggest problem ? no laughs . 
0	less-than-compelling documentary of a yiddish theater clan . 
0	that the chuck norris " grenade gag " occurs about 7 times during windtalkers is a good indication of how serious-minded the film is . 
0	viewers are asked so often to suspend belief that were it not for holm's performance , the film would be a total washout .

0	to paraphrase a line from another dickens' novel , nicholas nickleby is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato . 
0	the actresses may have worked up a back story for the women they portray so convincingly , but viewers don't get enough of that background for the characters to be involving as individuals rather than types .

0	plotless collection of moronic stunts is by far the worst movie of the year . 
0	however sincere it may be , the rising place never quite justifies its own existence . 
0	parker updates the setting in an attempt to make the film relevant today , without fully understanding what it was that made the story relevant in the first place .

0	the script becomes lifeless and falls apart like a cheap lawn chair . 
0	the script falls back on too many tried-and-true shenanigans that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy .

0	alternately frustrating and rewarding . 
0	it's impossible to even categorize this as a smutty guilty pleasure . 
0	despite suffering a sense-of-humour failure , the man who wrote rocky does not deserve to go down with a ship as leaky as this . 
0	swinging , the film makes it seem , is not a hobby that attracts the young and fit . or intelligent . 
0	the most memorable moment was when green threw medical equipment at a window ; not because it was particularly funny , but because i had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle's walker and toss it at the screen in frustration . 
0	see clockstoppers if you have nothing better to do with 94 minutes . but be warned , you too may feel time has decided to stand still . or that the battery on your watch has died . 
0	suffers from over-familiarity since hit-hungry british filmmakers have strip-mined the monty formula mercilessly since 1997 .

0	ultimately , in the history of the academy , people may be wondering what all that jazz was about " chicago " in 2002 . zellweger's whiny pouty-lipped poof faced and spindly attempt at playing an ingenue makes her nomination as best actress even more of a an a

0	sex with strangers will shock many with its unblinking frankness . but what is missing from it all is a moral . what is the filmmakers' point ? why did they deem it necessary to document all this emotional misery ? 
0	you see robin williams and psycho killer , and you think , hmmmmm . you see the movie and you think , zzzzzzzzz . 
0	downright transparent is the script's endless assault of embarrassingly ham-fisted sex jokes that reek of a script rewrite designed to garner the film a " cooler " pg-13 rating .

0	contains a few big laughs but many more that graze the funny bone or miss it altogether , in part because the consciously dumbed-down approach wears thin . 
0	nothing more than a widget cranked out on an assembly line to see if stupid americans will get a kick out of goofy brits with cute accents performing ages-old slapstick and unfunny tricks . 
0	this is a film tailor-made for those who when they were in high school would choose the cliff-notes over reading a full-length classic . 
0	the movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads . 
0	a jumbled fantasy comedy that did not figure out a coherent game plan at scripting , shooting or post-production stages . 
0	a sad and rote exercise in milking a played-out idea -- a straight guy has to dress up in drag -- that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title would imply . 
0	personal velocity ought to be exploring these women's inner lives , but it never moves beyond their surfaces . 
0	we hate [madonna] within the film's first five minutes , and she lacks the skill or presence to regain any ground . 
0	sounding like arnold schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , [ahola] has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that doesn't produce any real transformation . 
0	two big things are missing -- anything approaching a visceral kick , and anything approaching even a vague reason to sit through it all . 
0	a fascinating but choppy documentary . 
0	scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company . 
0	the doofus-on- the-loose banter of welcome to collinwood has a cocky , after-hours loopiness to it . and as with most late-night bull sessions , eventually the content isn't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is . 
0	too stagey , talky -- and long -- for its own good . 
0	apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap . 
0	the sinister inspiration that fuelled devito's early work is confused in death to smoochy into something both ugly and mindless . 
0	despite auteuil's performance , it's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug . 
0	director boris von sychowski instead opts for a routine slasher film that was probably more fun to make than it is to sit through . 
0	 . . . little more than a well-acted television melodrama shot for the big screen . 
0	never comes together as a coherent whole . 
0	an unintentionally surreal kid's picture . . . in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a vh1 behind the music episode . 
0	first , for a movie that tries to be smart , it's kinda dumb . and second , what's with all the shooting ? 
0	don't even bother to rent this on video . 
0	there is something in full frontal , i guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but like most movie riddles , it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see . 
0	this is the kind of movie that gets a quick release before real contenders arrive in september . 
0	not counting a few gross-out comedies i've been trying to forget , this is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes . 
0	plays like one long , meandering sketch inspired by the works of john waters and todd solondz , rather than a fully developed story . 
0	the film doesn't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made spy kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences . 
0	a mawkish self-parody that plays like some weird masterpiece theater sketch with neither a point of view nor a compelling reason for being . 
0	an average b-movie with no aspirations to be anything more .

0	gibney and jarecki just want to string the bastard up . 
0	the plot is plastered with one hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults .

0	 . . . stale and uninspired . 
0	a dreary movie . 
0	 . . . the story simply putters along looking for astute observations and coming up blank . 
0	instead of contriving a climactic hero's death for the beloved-major- character-who-shall- remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens' laser guns actually hit something for once ? 
0	it just didn't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on ( or be entertained by ) . 
0	this action-thriller/dark comedy is one of the most repellent things to pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage . 
0	mib ii is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything . that's because relatively nothing happens . 
0	no amount of arty theorizing -- the special effects are 'german-expressionist , ' according to the press notes -- can render it anything but laughable . 
0	blue crush follows the formula , but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling . 
0	boyd's screenplay ( co-written with guardian hack nick davies ) has a florid turn of phrase that owes more to guy ritchie than the bard of avon . 
0	there's not a spark of new inspiration in it , just more of the same , done with noticeably less energy and imagination .

0	a kilted jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces . 
0	contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs , the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster . 
0	starts out with tremendous promise , introducing an intriguing and alluring premise , only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter .

0	it's as if de palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up kraft macaroni and cheese . 
0	the movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter 'uhhh , ' which is better than most of the writing in the movie . 
0	worthy of the gong . 
0	while certainly more naturalistic than its australian counterpart , amari's film falls short in building the drama of lilia's journey .

0	oops , she's really done it this time . that chirpy songbird britney spears has popped up with more mindless drivel . 
0	it's a loathsome movie , it really is and it makes absolutely no sense . 
0	a chiller resolutely without chills . 
0	for those of us who respond more strongly to storytelling than computer-generated effects , the new star wars installment hasn't escaped the rut dug by the last one .

0	aggressive self-glorification and a manipulative whitewash . stay for the credits and see a devastating comic impersonation by dustin hoffman that is revelatory . 
0	none of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest . 
0	as social exposé , skins has its heart in the right place , but that's not much to hang a soap opera on . 
0	the whole film has this sneaky feel to it  as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product . 
0	there's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of queen of the damned , as its origins in an anne rice novel dictate , but generally , it's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance . 
0	the only way to tolerate this insipid , brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers .

0	like a can of 2-day old coke . you can taste it , but there's no fizz . 
0	there's no excuse for following up a delightful , well-crafted family film with a computer-generated cold fish . 
0	both the crime story and the love story are unusual . but they don't fit well together and neither is well told . 
0	it's both sitcomishly predictable and cloying in its attempts to be poignant . 
0	other than a mildly engaging central romance , hospital is sickly entertainment at best and mind-destroying cinematic pollution at worst . 
0	jaglom offers the none-too-original premise that everyone involved with moviemaking is a con artist and a liar . 
0	outside of burger's desire to make some kind of film , it's really unclear why this project was undertaken
0	was i scared ? only at the prospect of beck's next project . let's see , a haunted house , a haunted ship , what's next . . . ghost blimp ? 
0	a fragile framework upon which to hang broad , mildly fleshed-out characters that seem to have been conjured up only 10 minutes prior to filming . 
0	by the time the plot grinds itself out in increasingly incoherent fashion , you might be wishing for a watch that makes time go faster rather than the other way around . 
0	since lee is a sentimentalist , the film is more worshipful than your random e ! true hollywood story . 
0	wes craven's presence is felt ; not the craven of 'a nightmare on elm street' or 'the hills have eyes , ' but the sad schlock merchant of 'deadly friend . '
0	sunshine state surveys the landscape and assesses the issues with a clear passion for sociology . but the cinematography is cloudy , the picture making becalmed . 
0	it's one long bore . 
0	it gets old quickly . watch barbershop again if you're in need of a cube fix--this isn't worth sitting through . 
0	it's leaden and predictable , and laughs are lacking . 
0	 . . . a cinematic disaster so inadvertently sidesplitting it's worth the price of admission for the ridicule factor alone . 
0	skip this dreck , rent animal house and go back to the source . 
0	the movie is a desperate miscalculation . it gives poor dana carvey nothing to do that is really funny , and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time . 
0	we just don't really care too much about this love story . in that setting , their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting . 
0	the transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull . 
0	uzumaki's interesting social parallel and defiant aesthetic seems a prostituted muse . . . 
0	'men in black ii creates a new threat for the mib , but recycles the same premise . 
0	large budget notwithstanding , the movie is such a blip on the year's radar screen that it's tempting just to go with it for the ride . but this time , the old mib label stands for milder isn't better . 
0	feels familiar and tired . 
0	a retread of material already thoroughly plumbed by martin scorsese . 
0	instead of making his own style , director marcus adams just copies from various sources  good sources , bad mixture

0	an authentically vague , but ultimately purposeless , study in total pandemonium . 
0	makes a joke out of car chases for an hour and then gives us half an hour of car chases . 
0	as the sulking , moody male hustler in the title role , [franco] has all of dean's mannerisms and self-indulgence , but none of his sweetness and vulnerability . 
0	the only thing to fear about " fear dot com " is hitting your head on the theater seat in front of you when you doze off thirty minutes into the film . 
0	it's too interested in jerking off in all its byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience . 
0	'synthetic' is the best description of this well-meaning , beautifully produced film that sacrifices its promise for a high-powered star pedigree . 
0	it concentrates far too much on the awkward interplay and utter lack of chemistry between chan and hewitt .

0	doesn't get the job done , running off the limited chemistry created by ralph fiennes and jennifer lopez . 
0	a particularly joyless , and exceedingly dull , period coming-of-age tale . 
0	it's impossible to indulge the fanciful daydreams of janice beard ( eileen walsh ) when her real-life persona is so charmless and vacant . 
0	it wasn't the subject matter that ultimately defeated the filmit was the unfulfilling , incongruous , " wait a second , did i miss something ? " ending . 
0	this is a movie where the most notable observation is how long you've been sitting still . 
0	poor editing , bad bluescreen , and ultra-cheesy dialogue highlight the radical action . 
0	it's super- violent , super-serious and super-stupid . 
0	so earnest and well-meaning , and so stocked with talent , that you almost forget the sheer , ponderous awfulness of its script .

0	granddad of le nouvelle vague , jean-luc godard continues to baffle the faithful with his games of hide-and-seek . 
0	this loud and thoroughly obnoxious comedy about a pair of squabbling working-class spouses is a deeply unpleasant experience . 
0	it's better than the phantom menace . but unless you're an absolute raving star wars junkie , it isn't much fun . 
0	philosophically , intellectually and logistically a mess . 
0	a standard police-oriented drama that , were it not for de niro's participation , would have likely wound up a tnt original . 
0	coupling disgracefully written dialogue with flailing bodily movements that substitute for acting , circuit is the awkwardly paced soap opera-ish story .

0	though clearly well-intentioned , this cross-cultural soap opera is painfully formulaic and stilted . 
0	a technical triumph and an extraordinary bore .

0	what's missing is what we call the 'wow' factor . 
0	the nicest thing that can be said about stealing harvard ( which might have been called freddy gets molested by a dog ) is that it's not as obnoxious as tom green's freddie got fingered . 
0	 . . . tara reid plays a college journalist , but she looks like the six-time winner of the miss hawaiian tropic pageant , so i don't know what she's doing in here . . . 
0	the young stars are too cute ; the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative ; the message is too blatant ; the resolutions are too convenient . 
0	normally , rohmer's talky films fascinate me , but when he moves his setting to the past , and relies on a historical text , he loses the richness of characterization that makes his films so memorable . 
0	i highly recommend irwin , but not in the way this film showcases him . 
0	it's been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since i last walked out on a movie , but resident evil really earned my indignant , preemptive departure . 
0	this picture is mostly a lump of run-of-the-mill profanity sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office -- or trying to win over a probation officer . 
0	malone does have a gift for generating nightmarish images that will be hard to burn out of your brain . but the movie's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure . 
0	though it goes further than both , anyone who has seen the hunger or cat people will find little new here , but a tasty performance from vincent gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary . 
0	a blair witch- style adventure that plays like a bad soap opera , with passable performances from everyone in the cast .

0	it is too bad that this likable movie isn't more accomplished . the actors try hard but come off too amateurish and awkward . 
0	the plot has a number of holes , and at times it's simply baffling . 
0	an ill-conceived jumble that's not scary , not smart and not engaging . 
0	brainless , but enjoyably over-the-top , the retro gang melodrama , deuces wild represents fifties teen-gang machismo in a way that borders on rough-trade homo-eroticism . 
0	gets bogged down by an overly sillified plot and stop-and-start pacing . 
0	utter mush . . . conceited pap . 
0	 " what john does is heroic , but we don't condone it , " one of the film's stars recently said , a tortuous comment that perfectly illustrates the picture's moral schizophrenia . 
0	like coming into a long-running , well-written television series where you've missed the first half-dozen episodes and probably won't see the next six . 
0	this is no " waterboy ! " 
0	its generic villains lack any intrigue ( other than their funny accents ) and the action scenes are poorly delivered . 
0	dripping with cliche and bypassing no opportunity to trivialize the material . 
0	hard-core slasher aficionados will find things to like . . . but overall the halloween series has lost its edge . 
0	stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed .

0	too many improbabilities and rose-colored situations temper what could've been an impacting film . 
0	generic slasher-movie nonsense , but it's not without style . 
0	with tiny little jokes and nary an original idea , this sappy ethnic sleeper proves that not only blockbusters pollute the summer movie pool . 
0	it sticks rigidly to the paradigm , rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions and repeatedly placing them in contrived , well-worn situations . 
0	ever see one of those comedies that just seem like a bad idea from frame one ? 
0	once ice-t sticks his mug in the window of the couple's bmw and begins haranguing the wife in bad stage dialogue , all credibility flies out the window . 
0	the best drug addition movies are usually depressing but rewarding . quitting , however , manages just to be depressing , as the lead actor phones in his autobiographical performance . 
0	it would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi . 
0	in the end , all you can do is admire the ensemble players and wonder what the point of it is . 
0	for most movies , 84 minutes is short , but this one feels like a life sentence . 
0	while glover , the irrepressible eccentric of river's edge , dead man and back to the future , is perfect casting for the role , he represents bartleby's main overall flaw . 
0	something has been lost in the translation . . . another routine hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise . 
0	shatner is probably the funniest person in the film , which gives you an idea just how bad it was . 
0	tries so hard to be quirky and funny that the strain is all too evident . 
0	as immaculate as stuart little 2 is , it could be a lot better if it were , well , more adventurous . 
0	simply a re-hash of the other seven films . 
0	with jump cuts , fast editing and lots of pyrotechnics , yu clearly hopes to camouflage how bad his movie is . he fails .

0	by turns numbingly dull-witted and disquietingly creepy . 
0	boy , has this franchise ever run out of gas . 
0	one problem with the movie , directed by joel schumacher , is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time . 
0	the comedy is nonexistent . 
0	 . . . a bland , pretentious mess . 
0	it's a pedestrian , flat drama that screams out 'amateur' in almost every frame . 
0	a bland animated sequel that hardly seems worth the effort . 
0	it's not just the vampires that are damned in queen of the damned -- the viewers will feel they suffer the same fate . 
0	if religious films aren't your bailiwick , stay away . otherwise , this could be a passable date film . 
0	this is the case of a pregnant premise being wasted by a script that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience . 
0	the pace and the visuals are so hyped up that a curious sense of menace informs everything . 
0	stuffy , full of itself , morally ambiguous and nothing to shout about . 
0	it is most of the things costner movies are known for ; it's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it . 
0	don't let the subtitles fool you ; the movie only proves that hollywood no longer has a monopoly on mindless action . 
0	chai's structure and pacing are disconcertingly slack . 
0	to be oblivious to the existence of this film would be very sweet indeed . 
0	the director , with his fake backdrops and stately pacing , never settles on a consistent tone . 
0	one just waits grimly for the next shock without developing much attachment to the characters . 
0	instead of panoramic sweep , kapur gives us episodic choppiness , undermining the story's emotional thrust . 
0	the director seems to take an unseemly pleasure in [the characters'] misery and at the same time to congratulate himself for having the guts to confront it . 
0	this dubious product of a college-spawned ( colgate u . ) comedy ensemble known as broken lizard plays like a mix of cheech and chong and chips . 
0	the movie doesn't think much of its characters , its protagonist , or of us . 
0	super troopers is an odd amalgam of comedy genres , existing somewhere between the often literal riffs of early zucker brothers/abrahams films , and the decidedly foul stylings of their post-modern contemporaries , the farrelly brothers . 
0	 . . . will always be remembered for the 9-11 terrorist attacks . after seeing the film , i can tell you that there's no other reason why anyone should bother remembering it .

0	while [hill] has learned new tricks , the tricks alone are not enough to salvage this lifeless boxing film . 
0	in the real world , an actor this uncharismatically beautiful would have a résumé loaded with credits like " girl in bar #3 . " 
0	too much of it feels unfocused and underdeveloped . 
0	under 15 ? a giggle a minute . over age 15 ? big fat waste of time . 
0	hey arnold ! the movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size , and it ain't pretty . 
0	sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest . 
0	this is not the undisputed worst boxing movie ever , but it's certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience . 
0	you really have to wonder how on earth anyone , anywhere could have thought they'd make audiences guffaw with a script as utterly diabolical as this . 
0	in the end , we are left with something like two ships passing in the night rather than any insights into gay love , chinese society or the price one pays for being dishonest . 
0	chokes on its own depiction of upper-crust decorum . 
0	well-nigh unendurable . . . though the picture strains to become cinematic poetry , it remains depressingly prosaic and dull . 
0	i thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as i slogged my way through clockstoppers . 
0	while much of the cast has charm -- especially allodi and nolden -- the performers are sunk by the film's primitive approach to the mechanics of comedy . 
0	this directorial debut from music video show-off higuchinsky is all flash . 
0	yes , ballistic is silly . unfortunately , it's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies . 
0	the twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance , but twists are getting irritating , and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows . 
0	the longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it's actually pretty good in the first few minutes . 
0	while it's genuinely cool to hear characters talk about early rap records ( sugar hill gang , etc . ) , the constant referencing of hip-hop arcana can alienate even the savviest audiences . 
0	not only unfunny , but downright repellent .

0	it does nothing new with the old story , except to show fisticuffs in this sort of stop-go slow motion that makes the gang rumbles look like they're being streamed over a 28k modem . 
0	the kind of spectacularly misconceived enterprise that only a sophisticated cinephile could have perpetrated . 
0	makes for some truly odd , at times confusing , kids entertainment . . . but at least this time there's some centered storytelling to go along with all the weird stuff . 
0	the film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when carvey's saturday night live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment . 
0	jacquot's rendering of puccini's tale of devotion and double-cross is more than just a filmed opera . in his first stab at the form , jacquot takes a slightly anarchic approach that works only sporadically . 
0	chabrol has taken promising material for a black comedy and turned it instead into a somber chamber drama . 
0	it's as if you're watching a movie that was made in 1978 but not released then because it was so weak , and it has been unearthed and released now , when it has become even weaker . 
0	this is nothing but familiar territory . 
0	in execution , this clever idea is far less funny than the original , killers from space .

0	a broad , melodramatic estrogen opera that's pretty toxic in its own right . 
0	too slow , too long and too little happens . 
0	the film's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency . it's just filler . 
0	sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival foot-age with its less-than-objective stance .

0	on the bright side , it contains jesse ventura's best work since the xfl . 
0	despite impeccable acting . . . and a script that takes some rather unexpected ( even , at times , preposterous ) turns , love is just too , too precious in the end . 
0	a tv style murder mystery with a few big screen moments ( including one that seems to be made for a different film altogether ) . 
0	by getting myself wrapped up in the visuals and eccentricities of many of the characters , i found myself confused when it came time to get to the heart of the movie .

0	not an objectionable or dull film ; it merely lacks everything except good intentions .

0	so unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines . 
0	what was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian . 
0	a perplexing example of promise unfulfilled , despite many charming moments . 
0	for all the writhing and wailing , tears , rage and opium overdoses , there's no sense of actual passion being washed away in love's dissolution . 
0	a coarse and stupid gross-out . 
0	a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes . 
0	doesn't offer much besides glib soullessness , raunchy language and a series of brutal set pieces . . . that raise the bar on stylized screen violence . 
0	there's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like lavinia , to go the conservative route . 
0	it's one pussy-ass world when even killer-thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions . 
0	the stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious . 
0	but the power of these [subjects] is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration , rather than contributing to a film's narrative . 
0	rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment . 
0	tries to add some spice to its quirky sentiments but the taste is all too familiar . 
0	paid in full is so stale , in fact , that its most vibrant scene is one that uses clips from brian de palma's scarface . that's a cheat . 
0	harrison's flowers puts its heart in the right place , but its brains are in no particular place at all . 
0	this re-do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that , ironically , it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against . 
0	a string of rehashed sight gags based in insipid vulgarity . 
0	the movie is dawn of the dead crossed with john carpenter's ghosts of mars , with zombies not as ghoulish as the first and trains not as big as the second . 
0	basically a static series of semi-improvised ( and semi-coherent ) raps between the stars . 
0	too restrained to be a freak show , too mercenary and obvious to be cerebral , too dull and pretentious to be engaging . . . the isle defies an easy categorization . 
0	an unpredictable blend of gal-pal smart talk , romantic comedy and dark tragedy that bites off considerably more than writer/director john mckay can swallow . 
0	it's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible . 
0	 " the time machine " is a movie that has no interest in itself . it doesn't believe in itself , it has no sense of humorit's just plain bored . 
0	 . . . a hollow joke told by a cinematic gymnast having too much fun embellishing the misanthropic tale to actually engage it . 
0	a morose little soap opera about three vapid , insensitive people who take turns hurting each other . it's a feature-length adaptation of one of those " can this marriage be saved ? " columns from ladies home journal . . . 
0	the film's essentially over by the meet-cute . 
0	i'm sure if you're a hartley fan , you might enjoy yourself . . . me , i didn't care for it . 
0	it's about following your dreams , no matter what your parents think . socrates motions for hemlock . 
0	the script isn't very good ; not even someone as gifted as hoffman ( the actor ) can make it work . 
0	walter hill's pulpy , stylized boxing melodrama undisputed nearly overcomes its questionable in-the-ring match-up with solid fight choreography and gritty prison authenticity . 
0	it has all the excitement of eating oatmeal . 
0	it's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong . 
0	although there are several truly jolting scares , there's also an abundance of hackneyed dialogue and more silly satanic business than you can shake a severed limb at . 
0	i'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film . 
0	star trek : nemesis meekly goes where nearly every star trek movie has gone before . wince-inducing dialogue , thrift-shop costumes , prosthetic makeup by silly putty and kmart blue-light-special effects all conspire to test trekkie loyalty . 
0	like all abstract art , the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way , and -- unless prewarned -- it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all . 
0	i don't mind having my heartstrings pulled , but don't treat me like a fool . 
0	 . . . although this idea is " new " the results are tired . 
0	i'm guessing the director is a magician . after all , he took three minutes of dialogue , 30 seconds of plot and turned them into a 90-minute movie that feels five hours long . 
0	an unencouraging threefold expansion on the former mtv series , accompanying the stunt-hungry dimwits in a random series of collected gags , pranks , pratfalls , dares , injuries , etc . 
0	the script is a dim-witted pairing of teen-speak and animal gibberish . 
0	its well of thorn and vinegar ( and simple humanity ) has long been plundered by similar works featuring the insight and punch this picture so conspicuously lacks . 
0	for all its impressive craftsmanship , and despite an overbearing series of third-act crescendos , lily chou-chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam . 
0	don't be fooled by the impressive cast list - eye see you is pure junk . 
0	not since freddy got fingered has a major release been so painful to sit through . 
0	the documentary does little , apart from raising the topic , to further stoke the conversation . 
0	plays like a volatile and overlong w magazine fashion spread . 
0	a better title , for all concerned , might be swept under the rug . 
0	this movie seems to have been written using mad-libs . there can be no other explanation . hilariously inept and ridiculous . 
0	vera's technical prowess ends up selling his film short ; he smoothes over hard truths even as he uncovers them . 
0	[a] shapeless blob of desperate entertainment . 
0	feels too formulaic and too familiar to produce the transgressive thrills of early underground work . 
0	generic thriller junk . teens only . 
0	given how heavy-handed and portent-heavy it is , this could be the worst thing soderbergh has ever done . 
0	a by-the-numbers patient/doctor pic that covers all the usual ground
0	a dumb movie with dumb characters doing dumb things and you have to be really dumb not to see where this is going . 
0	stealing harvard aspires to comedic grand larceny but stands convicted of nothing more than petty theft of your time . 
0	pretension , in its own way , is a form of bravery . for this reason and this reason only -- the power of its own steadfast , hoity-toity convictions -- chelsea walls deserves a medal . 
0	with the exception of some fleetingly amusing improvisations by cedric the entertainer as perry's boss , there isn't a redeeming moment here . 
0	it's a grab bag of genres that don't add up to a whole lot of sense . 
0	movie fans , get ready to take off . . . the other direction . 
0	[director] o'fallon manages to put some lovely pictures up on the big screen , but his skill at telling a story -- he also contributed to the screenplay -- falls short . 
0	the intent is almost exactly the same [as the full monty] . all that's missing is the spontaneity , originality and delight . 
0	no one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through the master of disguise . 
0	even the finest chef can't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and robert de niro can't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy . 
0	there's too much falseness to the second half , and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull , ridiculous attempt at heart-tugging . 
0	it's not without its pleasures , but i'll stick with the tune . 
0	miller is playing so free with emotions , and the fact that children are hostages to fortune , that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affectation of seriousness . 
0	despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life , the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine . 
0	more maudlin than sharp . 
0	this is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director dario argento ( a producer here ) , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic . 
0	it's slow -- very , very slow . it's not the ultimate depression-era gangster movie . that's pure pr hype . 
0	characters still need to function according to some set of believable and comprehensible impulses , no matter how many drugs they do or how much artistic license avary employs . 
0	comes . . . uncomfortably close to coasting in the treads of the bicycle thief . 
0	visually rather stunning , but ultimately a handsome-looking bore , the true creativity would have been to hide treasure planet entirely and completely reimagine it . 
0	stealing harvard is evidence that the farrelly bros . -- peter and bobby -- and their brand of screen comedy are wheezing to an end , along with green's half-hearted movie career . 
0	there seems to be no clear path as to where the story's going , or how long it's going to take to get there . 
0	if you're a wwf fan , or you related to the people who watched the robots getting butchered in a . i . , you'll probably like rollerball . 
0	i don't think i laughed out loud once . and when you're talking about a slapstick comedy , that's a pretty big problem . 
0	it's so mediocre , despite the dynamic duo on the marquee , that we just can't get no satisfaction . 
0	slapstick buffoonery can tickle many a preschooler's fancy , but when it costs a family of four about $40 to see a film in theaters , why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead ? 
0	 . . . turns so unforgivably trite in its last 10 minutes that anyone without a fortified sweet tooth will likely go into sugar shock . 
0	the notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy . 
0	my reaction in a word : disappointment . his last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it . 
0	it kinda works and qualifies as cool at times , but is just too lame to work or be cool at others . 
0	sustains its dreamlike glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and voluptuous cheap effects , not the least of which is rebecca romijn-stamos . 
0	intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story's least interesting subject . 
0	a non-mystery mystery . 
0	feels haphazard , as if the writers mistakenly thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply tossing in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot . 
0	what an embarrassment . 
0	for each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses , many coming from the amazingly lifelike tara reid , whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout . 
0	in its own way , joshua is as blasphemous and nonsensical as a luis buñuel film without the latter's attendant intelligence , poetry , passion , and genius . 
0	i've always dreamed of attending cannes , but after seeing this film , it's not that big a deal . 
0	the vintage is pure '87 , with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message : fatal attraction = don't have an affair with a nutjob ; unfaithful = don't if you're married to one . 
0	a workshop mentality prevails . 
0	it cannot be enjoyed , even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick , primarily because it is dull . yes , dull . 
0	pumpkin wants to have it both ways . 
0	director uwe boll and the actors provide scant reason to care in this crude '70s throwback . 
0	[w]hile long on amiable monkeys and worthy environmentalism , jane goodall's wild chimpanzees is short on the thrills the oversize medium demands . 
0	outer-space buffs might love this film , but others will find its pleasures intermittent . 
0	this piece of channel 5 grade trash is , quite frankly , an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast . 
0	an occasionally funny , but overall limp , fish-out-of-water story . 
0	a bloated gasbag thesis grotesquely impressed by its own gargantuan aura of self-importance . . . 
0	it's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters , hit-and-miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes . 
0	as a rumor of angels reveals itself to be a sudsy tub of supernatural hokum , not even ms . redgrave's noblest efforts can redeem it from hopeless sentimentality . 
0	new best friend's playboy-mansion presentation of college life is laugh-out-loud ludicrous . 
0	an appalling 'ace ventura' rip-off that somehow manages to bring together kevin pollak , former wrestler chyna and dolly parton . if any of them list this 'credit' on their resumes in the future , that'll be much funnier than anything in the film . . . 
0	the humor is forced and heavy-handed , and occasionally simply unpleasant . 
0	scorsese at his best makes gangster films that are equally lovely but also relentlessly brutal and brutally intelligent ; perdition , meanwhile , reads more like driving miss daisy than goodfellas . 
0	while the script starts promisingly , it loses steam towards the middle and never really develops beyond attacking obvious target . 
0	as the latest bid in the tv-to-movie franchise game , i spy makes its big-screen entry with little of the nervy originality of its groundbreaking small-screen progenitor . 
0	this isn't even madonna's swept away . this is her blue lagoon . 
0	the director knows how to apply textural gloss , but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom . 
0	 . . . the film suffers from a lack of humor ( something needed to balance out the violence ) . . . 
0	burns never really harnesses to full effect the energetic cast . 
0	an overemphatic , would-be wacky , ultimately tedious sex farce . 
0	has all the depth of a wading pool . 
0	this is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another , narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse , and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing . 
0	the so-inept- it's-surreal dubbing ( featuring the voices of glenn close , regis philbin and breckin meyer ) brings back memories of cheesy old godzilla flicks . 
0	 . . . the movie is just a plain old monster . 
0	if this disposable tissue has one wild card , it's john turturro , who's simply fab as a spanish butler with a foot fetish . 
0	one long string of cliches . 
0	a noble failure . 
0	fancy a real downer ? [leigh] lays it on so thick this time that it feels like a suicide race . 
0	professionally speaking , it's tempting to jump ship in january to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller . 
0	nelson's brutally unsentimental approach . . . sucks the humanity from the film , leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle . 
0	weaves a spell over you , with its disturbingly close-up look at damaged psyches and its subtle undercurrents of danger . but its awkward structure keeps breaking the spell . 
0	at once half-baked and overheated . 
0	there's a solid woman- finding-herself story somewhere in here , but you'd have to dig pretty deep to uncover it . 
0	i still can't relate to stuart : he's a mouse , for cryin' out loud , and all he does is milk it with despondent eyes and whine that nobody treats him human enough . 
0	[serry] wants to blend politics and drama , an admirable ambition . it's too bad that the helping hand he uses to stir his ingredients is also a heavy one . 
0	by the miserable standards to which the slasher genre has sunk , . . . actually pretty good . of course , by more objective measurements it's still quite bad . 
0	the only entertainment you'll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair will be from unintentional giggles  several of them . 
0	sam mendes has become valedictorian at the school for soft landings and easy ways out . 
0	lástima por schwarzenegger , pero es hora de que deje la estafeta a las nuevas generaciones . 
0	exactly what it claims to be -- a simple diversion for the kids . 
0	its story may be a thousand years old , but why did it have to seem like it took another thousand to tell it to us ? 
0	woefully pretentious . 
0	the problem with this film is that it lacks focus . i sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie doesn't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand .

0	a relative letdown . 
0	better to just call it abc kiarostami . for aids and africa are nothing more than part of the scenery .

0	warmed-over hash . 
0	this rather superficial arthouse middle-brow film knows how to please a crowd , and that's about all it does well . 
0	it's clear the filmmakers weren't sure where they wanted their story to go , and even more clear that they lack the skills to get us to this undetermined destination . 
0	as vulgar as it is banal . 
0	a puzzling experience . 
0	you wonder why enough wasn't just a music video rather than a full-length movie . 
0	the film's tone and pacing are off almost from the get-go . 
0	the talented and clever robert rodriguez perhaps put a little too much heart into his first film and didn't reserve enough for his second .

0	even film silliness needs a little gravity , beyond good hair and humping . 
0	i felt sad for lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier , by rohmer , for example . 
0	prurient playthings aside , there's little to love about this english trifle . 
0	this is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed james bond into the mindless xxx mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs . 
0	the film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle . 
0	it's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up . the heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence . 
0	van wilder brings a whole new meaning to the phrase 'comedy gag . ' at least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch . 
0	a disappointment for those who love alternate versions of the bard , particularly ones that involve deep fryers and hamburgers . 
0	the film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip . the end result is a film that's neither .

0	there's enough melodrama in this magnolia primavera to make pta proud yet director muccino's characters are less worthy of puccini than they are of daytime television . 
0	however it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust . 
0	the humor isn't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original . but it could have been worse . 
0	some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny . 
0	even horror fans will most likely not find what they're seeking with trouble every day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor . 
0	comes off like a rejected abc afterschool special , freshened up by the dunce of a screenwriting 101 class . . . . designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , " crossroads " instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns . 
0	it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so
0	it's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface . 
0	the title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well . 
0	sometimes it feels as if it might have been made in the '70s or '80s , and starred chevy chase and goldie hawn . 
0	schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies , and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character .

0	the story drifts so inexorably into cliches about tortured ( and torturing ) artists and consuming but impossible love that you can't help but become more disappointed as each overwrought new sequence plods on . 
0	it should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit . so i just did .

0	aggravating and tedious . 
0	the ring just left me cold and wet like i was out in the seattle drizzle without rainwear .

0	for anyone who grew up on disney's 1950 treasure island , or remembers the 1934 victor fleming classic , this one feels like an impostor . 
0	a clutchy , indulgent and pretentious travelogue and diatribe against . . . well , just stuff . watching scarlet diva , one is poised for titillation , raw insight or both . instead , we just get messy anger , a movie as personal therapy . 
0	meandering , sub-aquatic mess : it's so bad it's good , but only if you slide in on a freebie .

0	 . . . hudlin is stuck trying to light a fire with soggy leaves . 
0	unlike his directorial efforts , la femme nikita and the professional , the transporter lacks besson's perspective as a storyteller .

0	audiences will find no mention of political prisoners or persecutions that might paint the castro regime in less than saintly tones . 
0	under-rehearsed and lifeless
0	the film takes too long getting to the good stuff , then takes too long figuring out what to do next . 
0	you can practically smell the patchouli oil . 
0	to say analyze that is de niro's best film since meet the parents sums up the sad state of his recent career . 
0	the actors don't inhabit their roles -- they're trapped by them , forced to change behavior in bizarre unjustified fashion and spout dialog that consists mostly of platitudes . 
0	an often-deadly boring , strange reading of a classic whose witty dialogue is treated with a baffling casual approach
0	this film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane , inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions . 
0	consists of a plot and jokes done too often by people far more talented than ali g
0	another week , another gross-out college comedy--ugh . 
0	laughably , irredeemably awful . 
0	moderately involving despite bargain-basement photography and hackneyed romance . 
0	there is no insight into the anguish of heidi's life -- only a depiction of pain , today's version of greek tragedy , the talk-show guest decrying her fate . 
0	the editing is chaotic , the photography grainy and badly focused , the writing unintentionally hilarious , the direction unfocused , the performances as wooden . 
0	when [de palma's] bad , he's really bad , and femme fatale ranks with the worst he has done .

0	i doubt anyone will remember the picture by the time christmas really rolls around , but maybe it'll be on video by then . 
0	uncertain in tone . . . a garbled exercise in sexual politics , a junior varsity short cuts by way of very bad things . 
0	all's well that ends well , and rest assured , the consciousness-raising lessons are cloaked in gross-out gags . 
0	the only thing worse than your substandard , run-of-the-mill hollywood picture is an angst-ridden attempt to be profound . 
0	if you think that jennifer lopez has shown poor judgment in planning to marry ben affleck , wait till you see maid in manhattan . 
0	stars matthew perry and elizabeth hurley illicit more than a chuckle , and more jokes land than crash , but ultimately serving sara doesn't distinguish itself from the herd . 
0	it's best to avoid imprisonment with the dull , nerdy folks that inhabit cherish . 
0	culkin exudes none of the charm or charisma that might keep a more general audience even vaguely interested in his bratty character . 
0	in the end , ted bundy's only justification is the director's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac ; there's no larger point , and little social context .

0	a movie that , rather than skip along the seine , more or less slogs its way through soggy paris , tongue uncomfortably in cheek .

0	imagine a really bad community theater production of west side story without the songs . 
0	soul is what's lacking in every character in this movie and , subsequently , the movie itself .

0	it may be a prize winner , but teacher is a bomb . 
0	the production values are up there . the use of cgi and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick . the voices are fine as well . the problem , it is with most of these things , is the script .

0	i'm not suggesting that you actually see it , unless you're the kind of person who has seen every wim wenders film of the '70s . 
0	while the film misfires at every level , the biggest downside is the paucity of laughter in what's supposed to be a comedy . 
0	if you liked the 1982 film then , you'll still like it now . 
0	a 93-minute condensation of a 26-episode tv series , with all of the pitfalls of such you'd expect . 
0	guillen rarely gets beneath the surface of things . she lists ingredients , but never mixes and stirs . 
0	audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school . 
0	to imagine the life of harry potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized woody allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is kung pow : enter the fist . 
0	it delivers some chills and sustained unease , but flounders in its quest for deeper meaning . 
0	credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter . 
0	i would have preferred a transfer down the hall to mr . holland's class for the music , or to robin williams's lecture so i could listen to a teacher with humor , passion , and verve . 
0	for the most part , the ingredients are there . but an unwillingness to explore beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents nettelbeck's film from coming together . 
0	an earnest , heartrending look at the divide between religious fundamentalists and their gay relatives . it's also heavy-handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views . 
0	a mawkish , implausible platonic romance that makes chaplin's city lights seem dispassionate by comparison . 
0	yes , one enjoys seeing joan grow from awkward young woman to strong , determined monarch , but her love for the philandering philip only diminishes her stature . 
0	it's a film that hinges on its casting , and glover really doesn't fit the part . 
0	this is a throwaway , junk-food movie whose rap soundtrack was better tended to than the film itself . 
0	 . . . with the candy-like taste of it fading faster than 25-cent bubble gum , i realized this is a throwaway movie that won't stand the test of time . it's a trifle . 
0	literally nothing in the pool is new , but if you grew up on the stalker flicks of the 1980's this one should appease you for 90 minutes . 
0	arguably the year's silliest and most incoherent movie . 
0	anyway , for one reason or another , crush turns into a dire drama partway through . after that , it just gets stupid and maudlin . too bad , but thanks to some lovely comedic moments and several fine performances , it's not a total loss .

0	the film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously . 
0	marries the amateurishness of the blair witch project with the illogic of series 7 : the contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie . 
0	the piano teacher is the sort of movie that discourages american audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film . 
0	if it's another regurgitated action movie you're after , there's no better film than half past dead . 
0	so what is the point ? lovingly choreographed bloodshed taking place in a pristine movie neverland , basically . 
0	this is junk food cinema at its greasiest . 
0	when it's all wet , blue crush is highly enjoyable . when it's on dry land , though , this surfer-girl melodrama starts gasping like a beached grouper . 
0	most new movies have a bright sheen . some , like ballistic , arrive stillborn . . . looking like the beaten , well-worn video box cover of seven years into the future . 
0	the story is naturally poignant , but first-time screenwriter paul pender overloads it with sugary bits of business .

0	a sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards . 
0	this dramatically shaky contest of wills only reiterates the old hollywood saw : evil is interesting and good is boring . 
0	before long , the film starts playing like general hospital crossed with a saturday night live spoof of dog day afternoon . 
0	the charms of willful eccentricity , at least as evidenced by this latest cinematic essay , are beginning to wear a bit thin . 
0	instead of accurately accounting a terrible true story , the film's more determined to become the next texas chainsaw massacre . but what about the countless other people who'd merely like to watch a solid tale about a universally interesting soul ? 
0	a silly , self-indulgent film about a silly , self-indulgent filmmaker . 
0	scarlet diva has a voyeuristic tug , but all in all it's a lot less sensational than it wants to be .

0	there's no mistaking the fact that this hybrid misses the impact of the disney classic , and even that of the excellent 1934 mgm version . 
0	a simple , sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting , but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within . 
0	roger michell , who did an appealing job directing persuasion and notting hill in england , gets too artsy in his american debut .

0	it is a comedy that's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling ( and an uneasy alliance , at that ) .

0	little more than a frothy vanity project . 
0	the film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending .

0	a bit of an unwieldy mess . 
0	with a story as bizarre and mysterious as this , you don't want to be worrying about whether the ineffectual broomfield is going to have the courage to knock on that door .

0	largely a for-fans artifact . 
0	there's no denying the elaborateness of the artist's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity . 
0	characters wander into predictably treacherous situations even though they should know better . 
0	there's plenty of style in guillermo del toro's sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply can't sustain more than 90 minutes .

0	much-anticipated and ultimately lackluster movie . 
0	this is really just another genre picture . 
0	each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception .

0	there is not a character in the movie with a shred of plausibility , not an event that is believable , not a confrontation that is not staged , not a moment that is not false . 
0	where last time jokes flowed out of cho's life story , which provided an engrossing dramatic through line , here the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines . 
0	why come up with something even quasi-original , when you can pillage from shirley jackson , richard matheson . . . and puke up something like rose red ? 
0	a broadly played , lowbrow comedy in which the cast delivers mildly amusing performances and no farm animals were injured by any of the gags . 
0	 . . . too gory to be a comedy and too silly to be an effective horror film .

0	the latest installment in the pokemon canon , pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where pokemon graze in peace .

0	too stupid to be satire , too obviously hateful to be classified otherwise , frank novak's irritating slice of lumpen life is as reliably soul-killing as its title is nearly meaningless . 
0	overly stylized with lots of flash black-&-white freeze frames reminiscent of a pseudo-hip luxury car commercial , ( it's ) at its worst when it's actually inside the ring . 
0	what is captured during the conceptual process doesn't add up to a sufficient explanation of what the final dance work , the selection , became in its final form .

0	if somebody was bored and . . . decided to make a dull , pretentious version of jesus' son , they'd come up with something like bart freundlich's world traveler . 
0	the best you can say about it is it's so uninspired , it barely gives one pause when considering some of the other dreck out there right now . 
0	a tough go , but leigh's depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film's often-mined and despairing milieu . 
0	an overstuffed compendium of teen-catholic-movie dogma . 
0	too leisurely paced and visually drab for its own good , it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing .

0	no worse than a lot of the crap we've been offered this summer , and slightly better than men in black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go . 
0	the plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset . 
0	at first , the sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious , but as the film goes on , the joke wears thin . 
0	never again swings between false sentiment and unfunny madcap comedy and , along the way , expects the audience to invest in the central relationship as some kind of marriage of true minds . 
0	the story itself is uninteresting , and the songs are painfully undistinguished : they might be giants' so to be one of us may be the most tuneless tune ever composed . 
0	este é apenas mais um ( longo ) episódio do programa da mtv . a única diferença é que , desta vez , a paramount teve o mau gosto de exibi-lo nos cinemas .

0	the title's lameness should clue you in on how bad the movie is . 
0	the parts are better than the whole ( bizarre , funny , tragic - like love in new york ) . 
0	while the film shuns the glamour or glitz that an american movie might demand , scherfig tosses us a romantic scenario that is just as simplistic as a hollywood production . 
0	the humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch , elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny .

0	denzel washington's efforts are sunk by all the sanctimony . 
0	if this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift , somebody unwrapped it early , took out all the good stuff , and left behind the crap ( literally ) . 
0	so faithful to the doldrums of the not-quite-urban , not-quite-suburban milieu as to have viewers recoiling from the reality check .

0	all the well-meaningness in the world can't erase the fact that the believer feels like a 12-step program for the jewish nazi . 
0	like most sequels , it takes what worked last time , repeats it and adds more characters , more stunts , more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness . 
0	there's no way to sort out the mess in our heads and deconstruct where it all went wrong . this is an hour and a half of daydreaming .

0	heavy-handed exercise in time-vaulting literary pretension . 
0	the movie is too cute to take itself too seriously , but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students . 
0	a thinly veiled excuse for wilson to play his self-deprecating act against murphy's well-honed prima donna shtick . 
0	a minor picture with a major identity crisis -- it's sort of true and it's sort of bogus and it's ho-hum all the way through . 
0	the movie succumbs to being nothing more than a formulaic chase in the dark . 
0	plays as hollow catharsis , with lots of tears but very little in the way of insights . 
0	it will come as no surprise that the movie isn't scary . but here's the real damn : it isn't funny , either . 
0	quick : who wants to see a comedy about shoddy airport security ? 
0	the reason i found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory . 
0	what you get with empire is a movie you've seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a latino in the lead . 
0	cho's fans are sure to be entertained ; it's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- i'm not one of them . 
0	looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter's imagination . 
0	the period -- swinging london in the time of the mods and the rockers -- gets the once-over once again in gangster no . 1 , but falls apart long before the end . 
0	high crimes miscasts nearly every leading character . 
0	the overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there's still a real sense that the star trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction . 
0	de niro looks bored , murphy recycles murphy , and you mentally add showtime to the pile of hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal . 
0	i didn't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot . 
0	another rent installment for the ian fleming estate . 
0	with danilo donati's witty designs and dante spinotti's luscious cinematography , this might have made a decent children's movie -- if only benigni hadn't insisted on casting himself in the title role . 
0	so lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun . 
0	though it draws several decent laughs , it's low-cal woody at best . 
0	has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags . 
0	britney's performance cannot be faulted . lucy's a dull girl , that's all . 
0	 " the kid stays in the picture " is a great story , terrifically told by the man who wrote it but this cliff notes edition is a cheat . 
0	well-shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons . 
0	sadly , hewitt's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns , not making snappy comebacks . 
0	if melville is creatively a great whale , this film is canned tuna . 
0	this film is so slick , superficial and trend-hoppy , that it's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay . 
0	just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story . or a profit . or some damn thing . 
0	the acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from gilligan's island -- and the cgi scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year . 
0	enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment . 
0	the makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep . i like frank the pug , though . 
0	a restrained ribisi convinces as an italian , though if ever a movie needed one of the actor's whiny jags to pump it up , this has to be among the rare ones . 
0	gee , a second assassin shot kennedy ? moot point . 
0	a hysterical yet humorless disquisition on the thin line between sucking face and literally sucking face . 
0	needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey . 
0	the problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , mr . desplechin is content to state it . 
0	madonna still can't act a lick . 
0	even the imaginative gore can't hide the musty scent of todd farmer's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship . 
0	if you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce . 
0	the episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life . but the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored . 
0	serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in america in 2002 . but hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour .

0	mckay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness
0	a recipe for cinematic disaster . . . part quentin tarantino , part guy ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it's all bad . 
0	the cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie's power as a work of drama .

0	even die-hard fans of japanese animation . . . will find this one a challenge . 
0	filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low . fortunately for all involved , this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water . 
0	the movie gets muted and routine . 
0	the issue of faith is not explored very deeply
0	it's a bad sign when you're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest .

0	when it comes to entertainment , children deserve better than pokemon 4ever . 
0	what the four feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about . 
0	while benigni ( who stars and co-wrote ) seems to be having a wonderful time , he might be alone in that . 
0	yes , 4ever is harmless in the extreme and it'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to spirited away ? 
0	preposterous and tedious , sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure . 
0	calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it's more like entertainment for trolls . 
0	none of these characters resembles anyone you've ever met in real life , unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter . 
0	 . . . just a big mess of a movie , full of images and events , but no tension or surprise . 
0	as elegantly crafted as it often is , anderson's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame .

0	 . . . has virtually no script at all . . . 
0	will only satisfy those who can't tell the difference between the good , the bad and the ugly . 
0	this kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch . but director danny devito and screenwriter adam resnick ( remember cabin boy ? ) just pound away . 
0	at times , however , dogtown and z-boys lapses into an insider's lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow , or care about . 
0	rather quickly , the film falls into a soothing formula of brotherly conflict and reconciliation . 
0	screenwriters scott abbott and michael petroni have turned rice's complex akasha into a cartoon monster . 
0	the writers , director wally wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : kappa rho alpha phi . 
0	bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description . 
0	the new faces are interesting , but the old story isn't , especially when it starts to seem more improvised than scripted . 
0	most of the action setups are incoherent . 
0	liman , of swingers and go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase . 
0	 . . . surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs . 
0	the problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball . 
0	dreary , highly annoying . . . 'some body' will appeal to no one . 
0	a prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell . 
0	there's something deeply creepy about never again , a new arrow in schaeffer's quiver of ineptitudes . 
0	the problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one , there's no saving the movie . sorry , charlie
0	a painfully leaden film destined for pre-dawn cable television slots . 
0	blessed with immense physical prowess he may well be , but ahola is simply not an actor . and in truth , cruel as it may sound , he makes arnold schwarzenegger look like spencer tracy . 
0	the cartoon that isn't really good enough to be on afternoon tv is now a movie that isn't really good enough to be in theaters . 
0	shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker's bottomless pit of self-absorption . 
0	this pep-talk for faith , hope and charity does little to offend , but if saccharine earnestness were a crime , the film's producers would be in the clink for life . 
0	all ends well , sort of , but the frenzied comic moments never click . 
0	if this is the danish idea of a good time , prospective tourists might want to consider a different destination -- some jolly country embroiled in a bloody civil war , perhaps . 
0	formula 51 is so trite that even yu's high-energy action stylings can't break through the stupor . 
0	only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives , still with the boiler suit and white mask , which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry . 
0	when the painted backdrops in a movie are more alive than its characters , you know you're in trouble . 
0	[two] fairly dull -- contrasting and interlocking stories about miserable scandinavian settlers in 18th-century canada , and yuppie sailboaters in the here and now . 
0	the film is really not so much bad as bland . 
0	the central story lacks punch . 
0	though ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention . 
0	this may be the dumbest , sketchiest movie on record about an aspiring writer's coming-of-age . 
0	succumbs to the same kind of maudlin , sentimental mysticism that mars the touched by an angel school of non-god spiritual-uplift movies . 
0	a harmless and mildly amusing family comedy . 
0	what was subtle and mystifying in the novella is now broad and farcical . 
0	the kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion . 
0	 " men in black ii , " has all the earmarks of a sequel . the story is less vibrant , the jokes are a little lukewarm , but will anyone really care ? 
0	sucking all the 'classic' out of robert louis stevenson's treasure island and filling the void with sci-fi video game graphics and disney-fied adolescent angst . . . 
0	this 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it's a tad slow . 
0	while super troopers is above academy standards , its quintet of writers could still use some more schooling . 
0	a mix of velocity and idiocy , this ruinous remake lacks the brawn -- and the brains -- of the 1970s original . 
0	the low-budget full frontal was one of the year's murkiest , intentionally obscure and self-indulgent pictures , and solaris is its big-budget brother . 
0	the plot is very clever , but boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of . 
0	the film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future quentin tarantino picture
0	a free-for-all of half-baked thoughts , clumsily used visual tricks and self-indulgent actor moments . 
0	apallingly absurd . . . the chemistry or lack thereof between newton and wahlberg could turn an imax theater into a 9 " black and white portable tv . 
0	a well acted and well intentioned snoozer . 
0	the smug , oily demeanor that donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named pipe dream is just repulsive . 
0	must-see viewing for anyone involved in the high-tech industry . others may find it migraine-inducing , despite moore's attempts at whimsy and spoon feeding . 
0	despite its good nature and some genuinely funny moments , super troopers suffers from a bad case of arrested development . 
0	it's hard not to feel you've just watched a feature-length video game with some really heavy back story . 
0	i watched the brainless insanity of no such thing with mounting disbelief . 
0	this limp gender-bender-baller from a first-time director and rookie screenwriter steals wholesale from that 1982's tootsie , forgetting only to retain a single laugh . 
0	kwan makes the mix-and- match metaphors intriguing , while lulling us into torpor with his cultivated allergy to action . 
0	while obviously an extremely personal work , it remains inextricably stuck in an emotionally unavailable rut . 
0	any movie this boring should be required to have ushers in the theater that hand you a cup of coffee every few minutes . like a marathon runner trying to finish a race , you need a constant influx of liquid just to get through it . 
0	i loved looking at this movie . i just didn't care as much for the story . 
0	has all the poignancy of a hallmark card and all the comedy of a gallagher stand-up act . 
0	it doesn't do the original any particular dishonor , but neither does it exude any charm or personality . 
0	fear dot com is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense . 
0	a gorgeous , somnolent show that is splendidly mummified and thoroughly unsurprising . 
0	a semi-autobiographical film that's so sloppily written and cast that you cannot believe anyone more central to the creation of bugsy than the caterer had anything to do with it . 
0	it feels like a community theater production of a great broadway play : even at its best , it will never hold a candle to the original . 
0	the film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other . 
0	the element of surprise might be the only thing femme fatale has going for it . 
0	it's the kind of movie you can't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch , yet you can't bring yourself to dislike it . 
0	maybe it's asking too much , but if a movie is truly going to inspire me , i want a little more than this . 
0	a graceless , witless attempt at mating some like it hot with the wwii espionage thriller . 
0	the story and characters are nowhere near gripping enough . 
0	based on a david leavitt story , the film shares that writer's usual blend of observant cleverness , too-facile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness . 
0	just like every other seagal movie , only louder and without that silly ponytail . 
0	to enjoy this movie's sharp dialogue and delightful performance by jolie and burns , you have to gloss over the no sense ending . 
0	national lampoon's van wilder could be the worst thing to come out of national lampoon since class reunion
0	this is a great subject for a movie , but hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director john woo has built his career on . 
0	ecks this one off your must-see list . 
0	overall , the film misses the brilliance of jelinek's novel by some way . it settles for being merely grim . 
0	the irwins emerge unscathed , but the fictional footage is unconvincing and criminally badly acted . 
0	it's not thirsty , consuming passion which drives this movie . no , it's the repetition of said behavior , and so children of the century is more mindless love than mad , more grating and boring than anything else . 
0	just because it really happened to you , honey , doesn't mean that it's interesting to anyone else . 
0	just like the deli sandwich : lots of ham , lots of cheese , with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after ( or during ) consumption of its second half .

0	this isn't a " friday " worth waiting for . 
0	everything that's worthwhile about collision course can already be seen on television . 
0	if this movie belonged to a sorority , it would be called beta alpha delta . 
0	not a cheap slasher flick , as the subject matter would suggest , but is a little like a nature film , showing a patient predator and his foolish prey . 
0	uneasy mishmash of styles and genres . 
0	herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among germany and eastern european jews might have changed 20th-century history is undermined by ahola's inadequate performance . 
0	all in all , there's only one thing to root for : expulsion for everyone . 
0	beyond a handful of mildly amusing lines . . . there just isn't much to laugh at . 
0	secret ballot is too contemplative to be really funny . 
0	the film's center will not hold . 
0	myers never knows when to let a gag die ; thus , we're subjected to one mind-numbingly lengthy riff on poo and pee jokes after another . 
0	too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise . 
0	a great ending doesn't make up for a weak movie , and crazy as hell doesn't even have a great ending . 
0	dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter . 
0	its over-reliance on genre conventions , character types and formulaic conflict resolutions crushes all the goodwill it otherwise develops . 
0	as an actor , the rock is aptly named . 
0	a mostly tired retread of several other mob tales . 
0	i wish i could say " thank god it's friday " , but the truth of the matter is i was glad when it was over . 
0	nothing about it fits . 
0	as it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends , it fails to lend the characters' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them . 
0	somehow we're meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids , travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world , don fatigues and become g . i . jane . 
0	the cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big . . . and the setting remains indistinct . 
0	consider the title's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept . 
0	the movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable . i tried to read the time on my watch . 
0	the film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in chinese history : war , revolution , communism , etc . 
0	johnson has , in his first film , set himself a task he is not nearly up to . 
0	ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , 'what's the point ? '
0	the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect . 
0	the film meant well in its horse tale about freedom , but wasn't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing . 
0	the movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel . 
0	once the audience figure out what's being said , the filmmaker's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care . 
0	there's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought . 
0	it seems just a long , convoluted ploy to get men into drag -- period drag , no less .

0	bears is bad . not 'terrible filmmaking' bad , but more like , 'i once had a nightmare like this , and it's now coming true' bad . 
0	as is most commonly case with projects such noble and lofty ambitions , the film is less poetic than simply pretentious . 
0	george , hire a real director and good writers for the next installment , please . 
0	for a film about two mismatched buddies , crystal and de niro share little screen time and even less chemistry .

0	admirable , certainly , but not much fun to watch . for caine lovers only . 
0	a shambles of a movie--visually unattractive , unbearably loud and utterly silly . . . its hilarity is completely unintentional . 
0	de niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to clint eastwood in the lazy bloodwork . but like bruce springsteen's gone-to-pot asbury park , new jersey , this sad-sack waste of a movie is a city of ruins . 
0	no , it's not nearly as good as any of its influences . 
0	a reasonably efficient mechanism , but it offers few surprises and finds its stars slumming in territory they should have avoided . 
0	the rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is , although it's more comedy than suspense de palma creates . 
0	human nature talks the talk , but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the merely quirky from the surreal . 
0	city by the sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : it's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes . but what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing .

0	fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters . and forget about any attempt at a plot ! 
0	it will probably prove interesting to ram dass fans , but to others it may feel like a parody of the mellow , peace-and-love side of the '60s counterculture .

0	the action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , and the plot offers few surprises . 
0	i couldn't help but feel the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy . 
0	what madonna does here can't properly be called acting -- more accurately , it's moving and it's talking and it's occasionally gesturing , sometimes all at once . 
0	[a] painfully flat gross-out comedy . . . 
0	even if you're an elvis person , you won't find anything to get excited about on this dvd . 
0	the movie certainly has its share of clever moments and biting dialogue , but there's just not much lurking below its abstract surface . 
0	it's bedeviled by labored writing and slack direction . 
0	i'm sure there's a teenage boy out there somewhere who's dying for this kind of entertainment . 
0	the tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life . 
0	the film is a confusing melange of tones and styles , one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama . 
0	obviously , a lot of people wasted a lot of their time ( including mine ) on something very inconsequential . 
0	there's a little violence and lots of sex in a bid to hold our attention , but it grows monotonous after a while , as do joan and philip's repetitive arguments , schemes and treachery . 
0	it drowns in sap . 
0	deliberately and devotedly constructed , far from heaven is too picture postcard perfect , too neat and new pin-like , too obviously a recreation to resonate . 
0	it's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline ; everything that's good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that's just too boring and obvious . 
0	i'm giving it thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment . there's got to be a more graceful way of portraying the devastation of this disease . 
0	the good thing -- the only good thing -- about extreme ops is that it's so inane that it gave me plenty of time to ponder my thanksgiving to-do list . 
0	the modern-day characters are nowhere near as vivid as the 19th-century ones . 
0	blessed with a searing lead performance by ryan gosling ( murder by numbers ) , the movie is powerful and provocative . it's also built on a faulty premise , one it follows into melodrama and silliness . 
0	uneven performances and a spotty script add up to a biting satire that has no teeth . 
0	director jay russell stomps in hobnail boots over natalie babbitt's gentle , endearing 1975 children's novel . 
0	benigni's pinocchio is extremely straight and mind-numbingly stilted , its episodic pacing keeping the film from developing any storytelling flow . 
0	the troubling thing about clockstoppers is that it doesn't make any sense . 
0	with its paint fights , motorized scooter chases and dewy-eyed sentiment , it's a pretty listless collection of kid-movie clichés . 
0	mostly the film is just hectic and homiletic : two parts exhausting men in black mayhem to one part family values . 
0	kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper . 
0	a rote exercise in both animation and storytelling . 
0	the material and the production itself are little more than routine . 
0	the movie's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had . 
0	not even steven spielberg has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie . 
0	it's all surface psychodramatics . 
0	the mothman prophecies , which is mostly a bore , seems to exist only for its climactic setpiece . 
0	that frenetic spectacle [on the tv show] has usually been leavened by a charm that's conspicuously missing from the girls' big-screen blowout . 
0	kitschy , flashy , overlong soap opera . 
0	for all the time we spend with these people , we never really get inside of them . 
0	yet another arnold vehicle that fails to make adequate use of his particular talents . 
0	sandra bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ain't- she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff . 
0	an undistinguished attempt to make a classic theater piece cinematic . 
0	too many scenarios in which the hero might have an opportunity to triumphantly sermonize , and too few that allow us to wonder for ourselves if things will turn out okay . 
0	there is simply not enough of interest onscreen to sustain its seventy-minute running time . 
0	a wordy wisp of a comedy . 
0	broomfield's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient . 
0	[seagal's] strenuous attempt at a change in expression could very well clinch him this year's razzie . 
0	has the disjointed feel of a bunch of strung-together tv episodes . 
0	a series of escapades demonstrating the adage that what is good for the goose is also good for the gander , some of which occasionally amuses but none of which amounts to much of a story . 
0	ozpetek offers an aids subtext , skims over the realities of gay sex , and presents yet another tired old vision of the gay community as an all-inclusive world where uptight , middle class bores like antonia can feel good about themselves . 
0	a dopey movie clothed in excess layers of hipness . 
0	the sweetest thing is expressly for idiots who don't care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance . 
0	sinks so low in a poorly played game of absurd plot twists , idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters that even freeman can't save it . 
0	i realized that no matter how fantastic reign of fire looked , its story was making no sense at all . 
0	it made me realize that we really haven't had a good cheesy b-movie playing in theaters since . . . well . . . since last week's reign of fire . 
0	some movies were made for the big screen , some for the small screen , and some , like ballistic : ecks vs . sever , were made for the palm screen . 
0	sc2 is an autopilot hollywood concoction lacking in imagination and authentic christmas spirit , yet it's geared toward an audience full of masters of both . 
0	after all the big build-up , the payoff for the audience , as well as the characters , is messy , murky , unsatisfying . 
0	seems content to dog-paddle in the mediocre end of the pool , and it's a sad , sick sight . 
0	it's refreshing that someone understands the need for the bad boy ; diesel , with his brawny frame and cool , composed delivery , fits the bill perfectly . 
0	if all of eight legged freaks was as entertaining as the final hour , i would have no problem giving it an unqualified recommendation . 
0	suffers from a flat script and a low budget . 
0	there are deeply religious and spiritual people in this world who would argue that entering a church , synagogue or temple doesn't mean you have to check your brain at the door . the same should go for movie theaters . 
0	seemingly a vehicle to showcase the canadian's inane ramblings , stealing harvard is a smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former mr . drew barrymore . 
0	the film tries to touch on spousal abuse but veers off course and becomes just another revenge film . 
0	as it stands it's an opera movie for the buffs . 
0	la cinta comienza intentando ser un drama , rápidamente se transforma en una comedia y termina por ser una parodia absolutamente predecible
0	this franchise has not spawned a single good film . the crap continues . 
0	if only it were , well , funnier . 
0	its inescapable absurdities are tantamount to insulting the intelligence of anyone who hasn't been living under a rock ( since sept . 11 ) . 
0	high drama , disney-style - a wing and a prayer and a hunky has-been pursuing his castle in the sky . 
0	like its script , which nurses plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire olympic swim team through , the characters in swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull , brain-deadening hangover . 
0	one big blustery movie where nothing really happens . when it comes out on video , then it's the perfect cure for insomnia . 
0	like a comedian who starts off promisingly but then proceeds to flop , comedian runs out of steam after a half hour . 
0	the pairing does sound promising in theory . . . but their lack of chemistry makes eddie murphy and robert deniro in showtime look like old , familiar vaudeville partners . 
0	director chris eyre is going through the paces again with his usual high melodramatic style of filmmaking . 
0	as it stands , there's some fine sex onscreen , and some tense arguing , but not a whole lot more . 
0	i could just feel the screenwriter at every moment 'tap , tap , tap , tap , tapping away' on this screenplay . 
0	the picture doesn't know it's a comedy . 
0	a stupid , derivative horror film that substitutes extreme gore for suspense . 
0	the rollerball sequences feel sanitised and stagey . 
0	roman polanski directs the pianist like a surgeon mends a broken heart ; very meticulously but without any passion . 
0	nothing more than a run-of-the-mill action flick . 
0	lan yu is certainly a serviceable melodrama , but it doesn't even try for the greatness that happy together shoots for ( and misses ) . 
0	this is an action movie with an action icon who's been all but decommissioned . 
0	even if it is generally amusing from time to time , i spy has all the same problems the majority of action comedies have . 
0	much like robin williams , death to smoochy has already reached its expiration date . 
0	an annoying orgy of excess and exploitation that has no point and goes nowhere . 
0	a tired , unnecessary retread . . . a stale copy of a picture that wasn't all that great to begin with . 
0	an often unfunny romp . 
0	a worthy idea , but the uninspired scripts , acting and direction never rise above the level of an after-school tv special . 
0	twenty years later , reggio still knows how to make a point with poetic imagery , but his ability to startle has been stifled by the very prevalence of the fast-forward technology that he so stringently takes to task . 
0	it bites hard . 
0	ear-splitting exercise in formula crash-and-bash action . 
0	we have an actor who is great fun to watch performing in a film that is only mildly diverting . 
0	despite hoffman's best efforts , wilson remains a silent , lumpish cipher ; his encounters reveal nothing about who he is or who he was before . 
0	there's a thin line between likably old-fashioned and fuddy-duddy , and the count of monte cristo . . . never quite settles on either side . 
0	the emotional overload of female angst irreparably drags the film down . 
0	schaefer's . . . determination to inject farcical raunch . . . drowns out the promise of the romantic angle . 
0	like showgirls and glitter , the most entertaining moments here are unintentional . 
0	while some of the camera work is interesting , the film's mid-to-low budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work . 
0	the origin story is well told , and the characters will not disappoint anyone who values the original comic books . it's in the action scenes that things fall apart . 
0	impostor is a step down for director gary fleder . 
0	seagal , who looks more like danny aiello these days , mumbles his way through the movie . 
0	the movie is a negligible work of manipulation , an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents . 
0	lacks dramatic punch and depth . 
0	there are moments of real pleasure to be found in sara sugarman's whimsical comedy very annie-mary but not enough to sustain the film . 
0	i can analyze this movie in three words : thumbs friggin' down . 
0	sadly , 'garth' hasn't progressed as nicely as 'wayne . '
0	make like the title and dodge this one . 
0	this is not one of the movies you'd want to watch if you only had a week to live . 
0	the first hour is tedious though ford and neeson capably hold our interest , but its just not a thrilling movie . 
0	here's a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior . 
0	it's obvious [je-gyu is] trying for poetry ; what he gets instead has all the lyricism of a limerick scrawled in a public restroom . 
0	sweet home alabama is one dumb movie , but its stupidity is so relentlessly harmless that it almost wins you over in the end . 
0	[green is] the comedy equivalent of saddam hussein , and i'm just about ready to go to the u . n . and ask permission for a preemptive strike . 
0	no amount of good acting is enough to save oleander's uninspired story . 
0	a vile , incoherent mess . . . a scummy ripoff of david cronenberg's brilliant 'videodrome . '
0	murphy and wilson actually make a pretty good team . . . but the project surrounding them is distressingly rote . 
0	despite its raucous intent , xxx is as conventional as a nike ad and as rebellious as spring break . 
0	think the lion king redone for horses , with fewer deliberate laughs , more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite songs by bryan adams , the world's most generic rock star . 
0	it is one more celluloid testimonial to the cruelties experienced by southern blacks as distilled through a caucasian perspective . 
0	it's tough being a black man in america , especially when the man has taken away your car , your work-hours and denied you health insurance . 
0	a small fortune in salaries and stunt cars might have been saved if the director , tom dey , had spliced together bits and pieces of midnight run and 48 hours ( and , for that matter , shrek ) . 
0	an amateurish , quasi-improvised acting exercise shot on ugly digital video . 
0	the holes in this film remain agape -- holes punched through by an inconsistent , meandering , and sometimes dry plot . 
0	would benigni's italian pinocchio have been any easier to sit through than this hastily dubbed disaster ? 
0	unofficially , national lampoon's van wilder is son of animal house . officially , it is twice as bestial but half as funny . 
0	this is a fragmented film , once a good idea that was followed by the bad idea to turn it into a movie . 
0	mindless yet impressively lean spinoff of last summer's bloated effects fest the mummy returns . 
0	halfway through the movie , the humor dwindles . it's replaced by some dramatic scenes that are jarring and deeply out of place in what could have ( and probably should have ) been a lighthearted comedy . 
0	will be far more interesting to the soderbergh faithful than it will be to the casual moviegoer who might be lured in by julia roberts . . . 
0	authentic , and at times endearing , humorous , spooky , educational , but at other times as bland as a block of snow . 
0	[a] mess . 
0	control-alt-delete simone as quickly as possible
0	follows the original film virtually scene for scene and yet manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun . 
0	the filmmaker ascends , literally , to the olympus of the art world , but he would have done well to end this flawed , dazzling series with the raising of something other than his own cremaster . 
0	the screenplay comes across , rather unintentionally , as hip-hop scooby-doo . 
0	has lost some of the dramatic conviction that underlies the best of comedies . . . 
0	vaguely interesting , but it's just too too much . 
0	 . . . no charm , no laughs , no fun , no reason to watch . 
0	a generic family comedy unlikely to be appreciated by anyone outside the under-10 set . 
0	kung pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party . 
0	kurys seems intimidated by both her subject matter and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business . 
0	the film virtually chokes on its own self-consciousness . 
0	a manipulative feminist empowerment tale thinly posing as a serious drama about spousal abuse . 
0	everything in maid in manhattan is exceedingly pleasant , designed not to offend . it goes down easy , leaving virtually no aftertaste . 
0	a profoundly stupid affair , populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility . 
0	 . . . pays tribute to heroes the way julia roberts hands out awards--with phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism . 
0	time stands still in more ways that one in clockstoppers , a sci-fi thriller as lazy as it is interminable . 
0	as a director , eastwood is off his game -- there's no real sense of suspense , and none of the plot 'surprises' are really surprising . 
0	eccentric enough to stave off doldrums , caruso's self-conscious debut is also eminently forgettable . 
0	to work , love stories require the full emotional involvement and support of a viewer . that is made almost impossible by events that set the plot in motion . 
0	although barbershop boasts some of today's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television , music and stand-up comedy , this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless 70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom . 
0	a puzzle whose pieces do not fit . some are fascinating and others are not , and in the end , it is almost a good movie . 
0	would that greengrass had gone a tad less for grit and a lot more for intelligibility . 
0	the good is very , very good . . . the rest runs from mildly unimpressive to despairingly awful . 
0	'butterfingered' is the word for the big-fisted direction of jez butterworth , who manages to blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach . 
0	be forewarned , if you're depressed about anything before watching this film , you may just end up trying to drown yourself in a lake afterwards . 
0	a terrible adaptation of a play that only ever walked the delicate tightrope between farcical and loathsome . in the wrong hands , i . e . peploe's , it's simply unbearable
0	an inexperienced director , mehta has much to learn . 
0	a limp eddie murphy vehicle that even he seems embarrassed to be part of . 
0	dramatically lackluster . 
0	so muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker's characteristic style . 
0	a gushy episode of " m * a * s * h " only this time from an asian perspective . 
0	 " looking for leonard " just seems to kinda sit in neutral , hoping for a stiff wind to blow it uphill or something . 
0	nothing more than four or five mild chuckles surrounded by 86 minutes of overly-familiar and poorly-constructed comedy . 
0	definitely in the guilty pleasure b-movie category , reign of fire is so incredibly inane that it is laughingly enjoyable . 
0	good-looking but relentlessly lowbrow outing plays like clueless does south fork . 
0	entertaining enough , but nothing new
0	 . . . one resurrection too many . 
0	this is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout . even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life , the mood remains oddly detached . 
0	demeo is not without talent ; he just needs better material . 
0	in spite of featuring a script credited to no fewer than five writers , apparently nobody here bothered to check it twice . 
0	no one involved , save dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , and the script , credited to director abdul malik abbott and ernest 'tron' anderson , seems entirely improvised . 
0	initially gripping , eventually cloying pow drama . 
0	a timid , soggy near miss . 
0	works better in the conception than it does in the execution . . . winds up seeming just a little too clever . 
0	to the vast majority of more casual filmgoers , it will probably be a talky bore . 
0	observant intelligence constantly vies with pretension -- and sometimes plain wacky implausibility -- throughout maelstrom . 
0	this version of h . g . wells' time machine was directed by h . g . wells' great-grandson . they should have found orson welles' great-grandson . 
0	shunji iwai's all about lily chou chou is a beautifully shot , but ultimately flawed film about growing up in japan . 
0	with more character development this might have been an eerie thriller ; with better payoffs , it could have been a thinking man's monster movie . 
0	thriller directorial debut for traffic scribe gaghan has all the right parts , but the pieces don't quite fit together . 
0	 . . . would be a total loss if not for two supporting performances taking place at the movie's edges . 
0	there's not a single jump-in-your-seat moment and believe it or not , jason actually takes a backseat in his own film to special effects . 
0	goldbacher draws on an elegant visual sense and a talent for easy , seductive pacing . . . but she and writing partner laurence coriat don't manage an equally assured narrative coinage . 
0	though harris is affecting at times , he cannot overcome the sense that pumpkin is a mere plot pawn for two directors with far less endearing disabilities . 
0	the documentary is much too conventional -- lots of boring talking heads , etc . -- to do the subject matter justice . 
0	the movie itself appears to be running on hypertime in reverse as the truly funny bits get further and further apart . 
0	this is not a jackie chan movie . it's just a movie that happens to have jackie chan in it . and that makes all the difference . 
0	far too clever by half , howard's film is really a series of strung-together moments , with all the spaces in between filled with fantasies , daydreams , memories and one fantastic visual trope after another . 
0	the problem with movies about angels is they have a tendency to slip into hokum . a rumor of angels doesn't just slip -- it avalanches into forced fuzziness . 
0	no big whoop , nothing new to see , zero thrills , too many flashbacks and a choppy ending make for a bad film . 
0	i don't think this movie loves women at all . 
0	shankman . . . and screenwriter karen janszen bungle their way through the narrative as if it were a series of bible parables and not an actual story . 
0	a negligible british comedy . 
0	fails to convince the audience that these brats will ever be anything more than losers . 
0	stay away . far away . 
0	slack and uninspired , and peopled mainly by characters so unsympathetic that you're left with a sour taste in your mouth . 
0	skip this turd and pick your nose instead because you're sure to get more out of the latter experience . 
0	what can one say about a balding 50-year-old actor playing an innocent boy carved from a log ? 
0	trailer trash cinema so uncool the only thing missing is the " gadzooks ! " 
0	her film is like a beautiful food entrée that isn't heated properly , so that it ends up a bit cold and relatively flavorless . 
0	like the world of his film , hartley created a monster but didn't know how to handle it . 
0	no new plot conceptions or environmental changes , just different bodies for sharp objects to rip through . 
0	needs more impressionistic cinematography and exhilarating point-of-view shots and fewer slow-motion 'grandeur' shots and quick-cut edits that often detract from the athleticism . 
0	in the end , there isn't much to it . 
0	a waste of fearless purity in the acting craft . 
0	the film is ultimately about as inspiring as a hallmark card . 
0	anyone not into high-tech splatterfests is advised to take the warning literally , and log on to something more user-friendly . 
0	disreputable doings and exquisite trappings are dampened by a lackluster script and substandard performances . 
0	you could easily mistake it for a sketchy work-in-progress that was inexplicably rushed to the megaplexes before its time . 
0	directors harry gantz and joe gantz have chosen a fascinating subject matter , but the couples exposing themselves aren't all that interesting . 
0	yet another entry in the sentimental oh-those-wacky-brits genre that was ushered in by the full monty and is still straining to produce another smash hit . 
0	for those for whom the name woody allen was once a guarantee of something fresh , sometimes funny , and usually genuinely worthwhile , hollywood ending is a depressing experience
0	femme fatale offers nothing more than a bait-and-switch that is beyond playing fair with the audience . are we dealing with dreams , visions or being told what actually happened as if it were the third ending of clue ? 
0	it could have been something special , but two things drag it down to mediocrity -- director clare peploe's misunderstanding of marivaux's rhythms , and mira sorvino's limitations as a classical actress . 
0	fluffy neo-noir hiding behind cutesy film references . 
0	imagine susan sontag falling in love with howard stern . 
0	like being trapped inside a huge video game , where exciting , inane images keep popping past your head and the same illogical things keep happening over and over again . 
0	should have been worth cheering as a breakthrough but is devoid of wit and humor . 
0	the best thing about the movie is its personable , amusing cast . 
0	these guys seem great to knock back a beer with but they're simply not funny performers . 
0	everything was as superficial as the forced new jersey lowbrow accent uma had . 
0	o ótimo esforço do diretor acaba sendo frustrado pelo roteiro , que , depois de levar um bom tempo para colocar a trama em andamento , perde-se de vez a partir do instante em que os estranhos acontecimentos são explicados . 
0	director david fincher and writer david koepp can't sustain it . 
0	finally coming down off of miramax's deep shelves after a couple of aborted attempts , waking up in reno makes a strong case for letting sleeping dogs lie . 
0	a movie that feels like the pilot episode of a new teen-targeted action tv series . 
0	one of the most highly-praised disappointments i've had the misfortune to watch in quite some time . 
0	the animation and backdrops are lush and inventive , yet return to neverland never manages to take us to that elusive , lovely place where we suspend our disbelief . 
0	director shekhar kapur and screenwriters michael schiffer and hossein amini have tried hard to modernize and reconceptualize things , but the barriers finally prove to be too great . 
0	strong filmmaking requires a clear sense of purpose , and in that oh-so-important category , the four feathers comes up short . 
0	the thought of watching this film with an audience full of teenagers fixating on its body humour and reinforcement of stereotypes ( of which they'll get plenty ) fills me with revulsion . 
0	devolves into the derivative , leaning on badly-rendered cgi effects . 
0	anyone who gets chills from movies with giant plot holes will find plenty to shake and shiver about in 'the ring . '
0	a grand fart coming from a director beginning to resemble someone's crazy french grandfather . 
0	the script is a disaster , with cloying messages and irksome characters . 
0	both overstuffed and undernourished . . . the film can't be called a solid success , although there's plenty of evidence here to indicate clooney might have better luck next time . 
0	plods along , minus the twisted humor and eye-popping visuals that have made miike . . . a cult hero . 
0	hollywood has taken quite a nosedive from alfred hitchcock's imaginative flight to shyamalan's self-important summer fluff . 
0	the film's maudlin focus on the young woman's infirmity and her naive dreams play like the worst kind of hollywood heart-string plucking . 
0	a pretentious mess . 
0	predictably soulless techno-tripe . 
0	i firmly believe that a good video game movie is going to show up soon . i also believe that resident evil is not it . 
0	it has the air of a surprisingly juvenile lark , a pop-influenced prank whose charms are immediately apparent and wear thin with repetition . 
0	the plot meanders from gripping to plodding and back . 
0	this is cruel , misanthropic stuff with only weak claims to surrealism and black comedy . 
0	no amount of nostalgia for carvey's glory days can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that carvey's considerable talents are wasted in it . 
0	best described as i know what you did last winter . 
0	[taylor] takes us on a ride that's consistently surprising , easy to watch -- but , oh , so dumb . 
0	it's difficult for a longtime admirer of his work to not be swept up in invincible and overlook its drawbacks . 
0	lazily directed by charles stone iii . . . from a leaden script by matthew cirulnick and novelist thulani davis . 
0	though jones and snipes are enthralling , the movie bogs down in rhetoric and cliché . 
0	the most remarkable ( and frustrating ) thing about world traveler , which opens today in manhattan , is that its protagonist , after being an object of intense scrutiny for 104 minutes , remains a complete blank . 
0	an artsploitation movie with too much exploitation and too little art . 
0	the pacing is often way off and there are too many bona fide groaners among too few laughs . 
0	with lines that feel like long soliloquies -- even as they are being framed in conversation -- max is static , stilted . 
0	barely manages for but a few seconds over its seemingly eternal running time to pique your interest , your imagination , your empathy or anything , really , save your disgust and your indifference . 
0	writer/director burr steers emphasizes the q in quirky , with mixed results . 
0	one senses in world traveler and in his earlier film that freundlich bears a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers , and circles it obsessively , without making contact . 
0	in between the icy stunts , the actors spout hilarious dialogue about following your dream and 'just letting the mountain tell you what to do . '
0	the obligatory break-ups and hook-ups don't seem to have much emotional impact on the characters . 
0	make no mistake , ivans xtc . is a mess . 
0	hypnotically dull , relentlessly downbeat , laughably predictable wail pitched to the cadence of a depressed fifteen-year-old's suicidal poetry . 
0	the concept is a hoot . the trailer is a riot . the movie is a dud . 
0	it's a boring movie about a boring man , made watchable by a bravura performance from a consummate actor incapable of being boring . 
0	because the intelligence level of the characters must be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work , the movie contains no wit , only labored gags . 
0	it's hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie . 
0	some stunning visuals -- and some staggeringly boring cinema . 
0	these characters become wearisome .

0	never having seen the first two films in the series , i can't compare friday after next to them , but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days . 
0	the story is lacking any real emotional impact , and the plot is both contrived and cliched . 
0	a depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece of hackery . 
0	it's a bad action movie because there's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring .

0	much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome cliché . 
0	the film never rises above a conventional , two dimension tale
0	mark wahlberg . . . may look classy in a '60s-homage pokepie hat , but as a character he's dry , dry , dry . 
0	told in scattered fashion , the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject . 
0	the irony is that this film's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own . 
0	now i can see why people thought i was too hard on " the mothman prophecies " . 
0	if ever a concept came handed down from the movie gods on a silver platter , this is it . if ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it .

0	a feel-good movie that doesn't give you enough to feel good about . 
0	adolescents will be adequately served by the movie's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick , although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a 'topless tutorial service . '

0	oscar caliber cast doesn't live up to material
0	the problems of the people in love in the time of money are hardly specific to their era . they just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way . 
0	carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , 'if i stay positive , maybe i can channel one of my greatest pictures , drunken master . '
0	so putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film .

0	what could have been a pointed little chiller about the frightening seductiveness of new technology loses faith in its own viability and succumbs to joyless special-effects excess .

0	the lousy john q all but spits out denzel washington's fine performance in the title role . 
0	the whole thing feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas . 
0	what a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is ! 
0	the film is so packed with subplots involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film . 
0	opera on film is never satisfactory . the art demands live viewing . the innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen .

0	it's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay . 
0	terminally bland , painfully slow and needlessly confusing . . . the movie , shot on digital videotape rather than film , is frequently indecipherable . 
0	as dumb and cheesy as they may be , the cartoons look almost shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy .

0	reeboir varies between a sweet smile and an angry bark , while said attempts to wear down possible pupils through repetition . it has no affect on the kurds , but it wore me down . 
0	the actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen .

0	an uninspired preachy and clichéd war film . 
0	horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it isn't incomprehensible . 
0	a movie that harps on media-constructed 'issues' like whether compromise is the death of self this orgasm [won't be an] exceedingly memorable one for most people . 
0	slackers' jokey approach to college education is disappointingly simplistic -- the film's biggest problem -- and there are no unforgettably stupid stunts or uproariously rude lines of dialogue to remember it by . 
0	if festival in cannes nails hard- boiled hollywood argot with a bracingly nasty accuracy , much about the film , including some of its casting , is frustratingly unconvincing .

0	the film is so bad it doesn't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen . 
0	sheridan's take on the author's schoolboy memoir . . . is a rather toothless take on a hard young life . 
0	it jumps around with little logic or continuity , presenting backstage bytes of information that never amount to a satisfying complete picture of this particular , anciently demanding métier .

0	when it comes to the battle of hollywood vs . woo , it looks like woo's a p . o . w . 
0	there are a few chuckles , but not a single gag sequence that really scores , and the stars seem to be in two different movies . 
0	the chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones , but all it amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film . 
0	it's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast . 
0	the mushy finale turns john q into a movie-of-the-week tearjerker . 
0	content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance .

0	its message has merit and , in the hands of a brutally honest individual like prophet jack , might have made a point or two regarding life . 
0	[seems] even more uselessly redundant and shamelessly money-grubbing than most third-rate horror sequels . 
0	it's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread . 
0	neither as scary-funny as tremors nor demented-funny as starship troopers , the movie isn't tough to take as long as you've paid a matinee price . 
0	if swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh . 
0	what might've been an exhilarating exploration of an odd love triangle becomes a sprawl of uncoordinated vectors . 
0	the master of disguise may have made a great saturday night live sketch , but a great movie it is not . 
0	it's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the cannes film festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere . 
0	boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect . 
0	it's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic . unfortunately , that's precisely what arthur dong's family fundamentals does . 
0	has the marks of a septuagenarian ; it's a crusty treatment of a clever gimmick . 
0	like a medium-grade network sitcom--mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen . 
0	something must have been lost in the translation . 
0	becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any plympton film : boring . 
0	in the end , the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived , as if we're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses . 
0	chan's stunts are limited and so embellished by editing that there's really not much of a sense of action or even action-comedy . 
0	rock's stand-up magic wanes . hopkins , squarely fills the screen . action - mechanical . 
0	 " the tuxedo " should have been the vehicle for chan that " the mask " was for jim carrey . alas , it's the man that makes the clothes . 
0	for casual moviegoers who stumble into rules expecting a slice of american pie hijinks starring the kid from dawson's creek , they'll probably run out screaming . 
0	the biggest problem i have ( other than the very sluggish pace ) is we never really see her esther blossom as an actress , even though her talent is supposed to be growing . 
0	what puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in britney spears' first movie . 
0	plot , characters , drama , emotions , ideas -- all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing the scorpion king . 
0	city by the sea is a gritty police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics one could wish for . but how it washed out despite all of that is the project's prime mystery . 
0	whatever the movie's sentimental , hypocritical lessons about sexism , its true colors come out in various wet t-shirt and shower scenes . 
0	as a hybrid teen thriller and murder mystery , murder by numbers fits the profile too closely . 
0	there ain't a lot more painful than an unfunny movie that thinks it's hilarious . 
0	i enjoyed the movie in a superficial way , while never sure what its purpose was . 
0	what a pity . . . that the material is so second-rate . 
0	doesn't deliver a great story , nor is the action as gripping as in past seagal films . 
0	the kind of film that leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an ill-advised and poorly executed idea . 
0	nicks refuses to let slackers be seen as just another teen movie , which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy . 
0	nothing about the film -- with the possible exception of elizabeth hurley's breasts -- is authentic . 
0	amid the cliché and foreshadowing , cage manages a degree of casual realism . . . that is routinely dynamited by blethyn . 
0	mostly , shafer and co-writer gregory hinton lack a strong-minded viewpoint , or a sense of humor . 
0	no cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces wild . 
0	eddie murphy and owen wilson have a cute partnership in i spy , but the movie around them is so often nearly nothing that their charm doesn't do a load of good . 
0	strictly a 'guy's film' in the worst sense of the expression . 
0	there's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes . 
0	it's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as phoenix's . 
0	there's something fishy about a seasonal holiday kids' movie . . . that derives its moment of most convincing emotional gravity from a scene where santa gives gifts to grownups . 
0	we're left with a story that tries to grab us , only to keep letting go at all the wrong moments . 
0	like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories . 
0	there is nothing redeeming about this movie . 
0	the film has [its] moments , but they are few and far between . 
0	a dreary indulgence . 
0	i was trying to decide what annoyed me most about god is great . . . i'm not , and then i realized that i just didn't care . 
0	derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone . 
0	deserves high marks for political courage but barely gets by on its artistic merits . 
0	 . . . comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental . 
0	brosnan's finest non-bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes . 
0	a film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms , waiting for happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact . 
0	to me , it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy . 
0	tsai may be ploughing the same furrow once too often . 
0	flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they can't distract from the flawed support structure holding equilibrium up . 
0	zigzag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted . 
0	[a] crushing disappointment . 
0	how can such a cold movie claim to express warmth and longing ? in truth , it has all the heart of a porno flick ( but none of the sheer lust ) . 
0	nicks and steinberg match their own creations for pure venality -- that's giving it the old college try . 
0	episode ii-- attack of the clones is a technological exercise that lacks juice and delight . 
0	the problem with all of this : it's not really funny . 
0	[denis'] bare-bones narrative more closely resembles an outline for a '70s exploitation picture than the finished product . 
0	wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from lynch , jeunet , and von trier while failing to find a spark of its own . 
0	viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some freudian puppet . 
0	overall tomfoolery like this is a matter of taste . 
0	the mantra behind the project seems to have been 'it's just a kids' flick . ' translation : 'we don't need to try very hard . '
0	in all the annals of the movies , few films have been this odd , inexplicable and unpleasant . 
0	it takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what tuck everlasting is about . so here it is : it's about a family of sour immortals . 
0	an essentially awkward version of the lightweight female empowerment picture we've been watching for decades
0	the author's devotees will probably find it fascinating ; others may find it baffling . 
0	writer-director walter hill and co-writer david giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags . 
0	there's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces . 
0	a cockeyed shot all the way . 
0	lush and beautifully photographed ( somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book ) , but ultimately you'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered . 
0	unfortunately , one hour photo lives down to its title . thanks largely to williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film . 
0	cold , sterile and lacking any color or warmth . 
0	the film is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold . 
0	seems like someone going through the motions . 
0	for a film about explosions and death and spies , " ballistic : ecks vs . sever " seems as safe as a children's film . well , in some of those , the mother deer even dies . 
0	wallace gets a bit heavy handed with his message at times , and has a visual flair that waxes poetic far too much for our taste . 
0	impostor doesn't do much with its template , despite a remarkably strong cast . 
0	wraps itself in the guise of a dark and quirky comedy , but it isn't as quirky as it thinks it is and its comedy is generally mean-spirited . 
0	choppy , overlong documentary about 'the lifestyle . '
0	one sloughs one's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot . 
0	a film which presses familiar herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised . 
0	it's a fanboy 'what if ? ' brought to life on the big screen . 
0	the story itself is actually quite vapid . 
0	it's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it doesn't offer any insights that haven't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the dahmer heyday of the mid-'90s . 
0	wait for pay per view or rental but don't dismiss barbershop out of hand . 
0	a few zingers aside , the writing is indifferent , and jordan brady's direction is prosaic . 
0	each scene drags , underscoring the obvious , and sentiment is slathered on top . 
0	would've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film's predictable denouement . then nadia's birthday might not have been such a bad day after all . 
0	one of those staggeringly well-produced , joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next , hastily , emptily . 
0	nair just doesn't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy . 
0	enthusiastically taking up the current teen movie concern with bodily functions , walt becker's film pushes all the demographically appropriate comic buttons . 
0	it's the funniest american comedy since graffiti bridge . 
0	that neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions , defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks . 
0	what starts off as a possible argentine american beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers . 
0	the project's filmmakers forgot to include anything even halfway scary as they poorly rejigger fatal attraction into a high school setting . 
0	in old-fashioned screenwriting parlance , ms . shreve's novel proved too difficult a text to 'lick , ' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast . 
0	solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke
0	stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little * * * * . no cute factor here . not that i mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise . 
0	deep down , i realized the harsh reality of my situation : i would leave the theater with a lower i . q . than when i had entered . 
0	a really funny fifteen-minute short stretched beyond its limits to fill an almost feature-length film . 
0	aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom . com or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand . 
0	it is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment . 
0	for its 100 minutes running time , you'll wait in vain for a movie to happen . 
0	a work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse . 
0	a faster paced family flick . upper teens may get cynical . smaller numbered kidlets will enjoy . 
0	while this film has an 'a' list cast and some strong supporting players , the tale -- like its central figure , vivi -- is just a little bit hard to love . 
0	it's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns . 
0	most fish stories are a little peculiar , but this is one that should be thrown back in the river . 
0	it's all gratuitous before long , as if schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story . 
0	 " i blame all men for war , " [the warden's daughter] tells her father . the movie is about as deep as that sentiment . 
0	it's fitfully funny but never really takes off . 
0	i've seen some bad singer-turned actors , but lil bow wow takes the cake . 
0	by halfway through this picture i was beginning to hate it , and , of course , feeling guilty for it . . . . then , miracle of miracles , the movie does a flip-flop . 
0	for all the complications , it's all surprisingly predictable . 
0	it's been 20 years since 48 hrs . made eddie murphy a movie star and the man hasn't aged a day . but his showboating wise-cracker stock persona sure is getting old . 
0	if deuces wild had been tweaked up a notch it would have become a camp adventure , one of those movies that's so bad it starts to become good . but it wasn't . 
0	for a film about action , ultimate x is the gabbiest giant-screen movie ever , bogging down in a barrage of hype . 
0	 . . . a low rate annie featuring some kid who can't act , only echoes of jordan , and weirdo actor crispin glover screwing things up old school . 
0	it might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the saturday morning cartoons  a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness . 
0	the picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male all about eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the intermezzo strain .

0	doesn't really add up to much . 
0	it's better suited for the history or biography channel , but there's no arguing the tone of the movie - it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and questions on your mind .

0	it's difficult to discern if this is a crazy work of disturbed genius or merely 90 minutes of post-adolescent electra rebellion .

0	the camera whirls ! the camera twirls ! oh , look at that clever angle ! wow , a jump cut ! 
0	demme finally succeeds in diminishing his stature from oscar-winning master to lowly studio hack . 
0	the action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if kaos hadn't blown them all up . 
0	it almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us . 
0	it puts washington , as honest working man john q . archibald , on a pedestal , then keeps lifting the pedestal higher . 
0	ultimately , the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you're up for that sort of thing . 
0	far more enjoyable than its predecessor . 
0	[gayton's script] telegraphs every discovery and layers on the gloss of convenience . 
0	full frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre's definitive , if disingenuous , feature . 
0	a ragbag of cliches . 
0	this rough trade punch-and-judy act didn't play well then and it plays worse now . 
0	a reality-snubbing hodgepodge . 
0	the three leads produce adequate performances , but what's missing from this material is any depth of feeling . 
0	it's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling . 
0	this painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications . . . that have no bearing on the story . 
0	short and sweet , but also more than anything else slight tadpole pulls back from the consequences of its own actions and revelations . 
0	has its moments , but it's pretty far from a treasure . 
0	what more can be expected from a college comedy that's target audience hasn't graduated from junior high school ? 
0	collateral damage offers formula payback and the big payoff , but the explosions tend to simply hit their marks , pyro-correctly . 
0	the plan to make enough into an inspiring tale of survival wrapped in the heart-pounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller' has flopped as surely as a soufflé gone wrong . 
0	instead of letting the laughs come as they may , lawrence unleashes his trademark misogyny -- er , comedy -- like a human volcano or an overflowing septic tank , take your pick . 
0	you know that ten bucks you'd spend on a ticket ? just send it to cranky . we don't get paid enough to sit through crap like this . 
0	an even more predictable , cliche-ridden endeavor than its predecessor . 
0	the whole thing plays like a tired tyco ad . 
0	the film doesn't show enough of the creative process or even of what was created for the non-fan to figure out what makes wilco a big deal . 
0	the soupy end result has the odd distinction of being playful without being fun , too . 
0	no , i don't know why steven seagal is considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money . 
0	even by the intentionally low standards of frat-boy humor , sorority boys is a bowser . 
0	one well-timed explosion in a movie can be a knockout , but a hundred of them can be numbing . proof of this is ballistic : ecks vs . sever . 
0	halfway through , however , having sucked dry the undead action flick formula , blade ii mutates into a gross-out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary . 
0	weighted down with slow , uninvolving storytelling and flat acting . 
0	we can't accuse kung pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie . unfortunately , we'd prefer a simple misfire . 
0	there isn't one moment in the film that surprises or delights . 
0	'wouldn't it be nice if all guys got a taste of what it's like on the other side of the bra ? '
0	the movie is essentially a series of fleetingly interesting actors' moments . 
0	most of the information has already appeared in one forum or another and , no matter how broomfield dresses it up , it tends to speculation , conspiracy theories or , at best , circumstantial evidence .

0	the lousy lead performances . . . keep the movie from ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired . 
0	its and pieces of the hot chick are so hilarious , and schneider's performance is so fine , it's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in the animal -- is a slapdash mess . 
0	[creates] the worst kind of mythologizing , the kind that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama . 
0	the movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates . 
0	earnest and heartfelt but undernourished and plodding . 
0	a sugar-coated rocky whose valuable messages are forgotten 10 minutes after the last trombone honks . 
0	romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong . they cheapen the overall effect . 
0	has all the complexity and realistic human behavior of an episode of general hospital . 
0	an acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 8-10 , but it's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to mcdonald's , let alone some savvy street activism . 
0	[allen's] been making piffle for a long while , and hollywood ending may be his way of saying that piffle is all that the airhead movie business deserves from him right now . 
0	an exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound . 
0	mildly amusing . 
0	not good enough to pass for a litmus test of the generation gap and not bad enough to repulse any generation of its fans .

0	the story's pathetic and the gags are puerile . 
0	 . curiously , super troopers suffers because it doesn't have enough vices to merit its 103-minute length . 
0	so bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled generic jennifer lopez romantic comedy . 
0	i was sent a copyof this film to review on dvd . for free . i still want my money back . 
0	it plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its " dead wife communicating from beyond the grave " framework is even remotely new or interesting . 
0	it's hard to believe that a relationship like holly and marina's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive . 
0	all too familiar . . . basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when 'angels with dirty faces' appeared in 1938 . 
0	passable enough for a shoot-out in the o . k . court house of life type of flick . strictly middle of the road . 
0	although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out . 
0	after the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clichés , depression and bad alternative music . 
0	no one can doubt the filmmakers' motives , but the guys still feels counterproductive . 
0	a very slow , uneventful ride around a pretty tattered old carousel . 
0	with little visible talent and no energy , colin hanks is in bad need of major acting lessons and maybe a little coffee .

0	formula 51 promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip . 
0	everything that was right about blade is wrong in its sequel . 
0	a few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film , but the wheezing terrorist subplot hasn't the stamina for the 100-minute running time , and the protagonists' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun . 
0	the film was produced by jerry bruckheimer and directed by joel schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one ( and no one ) . 
0	disney again ransacks its archives for a quick-buck sequel . 
0	 coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars hugh grant and sandra bullock . 
0	anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy . 
0	how much you are moved by the emotional tumult of [françois and michèle's] relationship depends a lot on how interesting and likable you find them . 
0	they presume their audience won't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes . 
0	collapses after 30 minutes into a slap-happy series of adolescent violence . 
0	the following things are not at all entertaining : the bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , watching seinfeld ( who is also one of the film's producers ) do everything he can to look like a good guy . 
0	attal's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare i say , outdated , it's a wonder that he couldn't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident . 
0	obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque . 
0	the most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters . 
0	michele is a such a brainless flibbertigibbet that it's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously . 
0	ultimately , clarity matters , both in breaking codes and making movies . enigma lacks it . 
0	potty-mouthed enough for pg-13 , yet not as hilariously raunchy as south park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults . 
0	 . . . has its moments , but ultimately , its curmudgeon doesn't quite make the cut of being placed on any list of favorites . 
0	a distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely feature-length running time of one hour . 
0	most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement . 
0	in the end , tuck everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived : too much to do , too little time to do it in . 
0	rather less than the sum of its underventilated père-fils confrontations . 
0	mckay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative . 
0	plays like a series of vignettes -- clips of a film that are still looking for a common through-line . 
0	new yorkers always seem to find the oddest places to dwell . . . 
0	amid the shock and curiosity factors , the film is just a corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way . 
0	yes , spirited away is a triumph of imagination , but it's also a failure of storytelling . 
0	a characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie . 
0	a somewhat disappointing and meandering saga . 
0	whenever you think you've seen the end of the movie , we cut to a new scene , which also appears to be the end . but , no , we get another scene , and then another . you begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain . 
0	an empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility . 
0	the screenplay , co-written by director imogen kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing . 
0	the milieu is wholly unconvincing . . . and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch . 
0	unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters . 
0	each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time . 
0	except for paymer as the boss who ultimately expresses empathy for bartleby's pain , the performances are so stylized as to be drained of human emotion . 
0	will no doubt delight plympton's legion of fans ; others may find 80 minutes of these shenanigans exhausting . 
0	the laughs are as rare as snake foo yung . 
0	for a film that celebrates radical , nonconformist values , what to do in case of fire ? lazily and glumly settles into a most traditional , reserved kind of filmmaking . 
0	knockaround guys plays like a student film by two guys who desperately want to be quentin tarantino when they grow up . but they lack their idol's energy and passion for detail . 
0	mattei so completely loses himself to the film's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , love in the time of money . 
0	it briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest - audience sadism -- is evaded completely . 
0	holland lets things peter out midway , but it's notably better acted -- and far less crass - than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals . 
0	for every articulate player , such as skateboarder tony hawk or bmx rider mat hoffman , are about a half dozen young turks angling to see how many times they can work the words " radical " or " suck " into a sentence . 
0	there's not a fresh idea at the core of this tale . 
0	an impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle . 
0	it's unfortunate that wallace , who wrote gibson's braveheart as well as the recent pearl harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue . 
0	i liked the movie , but i know i would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further . i'm left slightly disappointed that it didn't . 
0	dreary tale of middle-class angst
0	for a movie about the power of poetry and passion , there is precious little of either . 
0	[jackson and bledel] seem to have been picked not for their acting chops , but for their looks and appeal to the pre-teen crowd . 
0	lillard and cardellini earn their scooby snacks , but not anyone else . 
0	like schindler's list , the grey zone attempts to be grandiloquent , but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way . 
0	an unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film . 
0	[screenwriter] pimental took the farrelly brothers comedy and feminized it , but it is a rather poor imitation . 
0	it's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey . 
0	friday after next is a lot more bluster than bite . 
0	its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomach-churning gore will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up . 
0	a decidedly mixed bag . 
0	meandering and confusing . 
0	there are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels . 
0	ice cube isn't quite out of ripe screwball ideas , but friday after next spreads them pretty thin . 
0	not everything in the film works , including its somewhat convenient ending . 
0	the characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality . 
0	everything else about high crimes is , like the military system of justice it portrays , tiresomely regimented . 
0	just dreadful . i don't blame eddie murphy but shouldn't owen wilson know a movie must have a story and a script ? 
0	sweet home alabama certainly won't be remembered as one of [witherspoon's] better films . 
0	hard as this may be to believe , here on earth , a surprisingly similar teen drama , was a better film . 
0	this is just lazy writing . even kids deserve better . 
0	the pretensions -- and disposable story -- sink the movie . and diesel isn't the actor to save it . 
0	bravo reveals the true intent of her film by carefully selecting interview subjects who will construct a portrait of castro so predominantly charitable it can only be seen as propaganda . 
0	 . . . a preachy parable stylized with a touch of john woo bullet ballet . 
0	frank capra played this story straight . but the 2002 film doesn't really believe in it , and breaks the mood with absurdly inappropriate 'comedy' scenes . 
0	how about starting with a more original story instead of just slapping extreme humor and gross-out gags on top of the same old crap ? 
0	the problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull . 
0	handled correctly , wilde's play is a masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice . here , alas , it collapses like an overcooked soufflé . 
0	 " sorority boys " was funnier , and that movie was pretty bad . 
0	a bizarre piece of work , with premise and dialogue at the level of kids' television and plot threads as morose as teen pregnancy , rape and suspected murder
0	paul bettany is good at being the ultra-violent gangster wannabe , but the movie is certainly not number 1 . 
0	it's a gag that's worn a bit thin over the years , though don't ask still finds a few chuckles . 
0	an uplifting drama . . . what antwone fisher isn't , however , is original . 
0	often likable , but just as often it's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would come in handy . 
0	certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike , eight crazy nights is a total misfire . 
0	elaborate special effects take centre screen , so that the human story is pushed to one side . 
0	showtime isn't particularly assaultive , but it can still make you feel that you never want to see another car chase , explosion or gunfight again . 
0	all the characters are clinically depressed and have abandoned their slim hopes and dreams . 
0	this tuxedo . . . should have been sent back to the tailor for some major alterations . 
0	i have no problem with " difficult " movies , or movies that ask the audience to meet them halfway and connect the dots instead of having things all spelled out . but first , you have to give the audience a reason to <b>want</b> to put for that effort , and " i
0	been there , done that . . . a thousand times already , and better . 
0	what's most offensive isn't the waste of a good cast , but the film's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism . 
0	sunk by way too much indulgence of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness . 
0	fans of plympton's shorts may marginally enjoy the film , but it is doubtful this listless feature will win him any new viewers . 
0	barrels along at the start before becoming mired in sentimentality . 
0	none of this sounds promising and , indeed , the first half of sorority boys is as appalling as any 'comedy' to ever spill from a projector's lens . 
0	the kind of movie that leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory of its operational mechanics . 
0	'punch-drunk love is so convinced of its own brilliance that , if it were a person , you'd want to smash its face in . '
0	at once overly old-fashioned in its sudsy plotting and heavy-handed in its effort to modernize it with encomia to diversity and tolerance . 
0	the trashy teen-sleaze equivalent of showgirls . 
0	while the production details are lavish , film has little insight into the historical period and its artists , particularly in how sand developed a notorious reputation .

0	what 'blade runner' would've looked like as a low-budget series on a uhf channel . 
0	doesn't add up to much . 
0	has all the values of a straight-to-video movie , but because it has a bigger-name cast , it gets a full theatrical release . 
0	with its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , all about the benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s . 
0	it never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time . 
0	loud , silly , stupid and pointless . 
0	mandel holland's direction is uninspired , and his scripting unsurprising , but the performances by phifer and black are ultimately winning . you'll find yourself wishing that you and they were in another movie . 
0	a yawn-provoking little farm melodrama . 
0	did no one on the set have a sense of humor , or did they not have the nerve to speak up ? 
0	crummy
0	seriously , rent the disney version . 
0	as david letterman and the onion have proven , the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor , but lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them .

0	meticulously mounted , exasperatingly well-behaved film , which ticks off kahlo's lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant . 
0	time of favor could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation . 
0	i'm not sure which will take longer to heal : the welt on johnny knoxville's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche . 
0	while serving sara does have a long way to go before it reaches the level of crudity in the latest austin powers extravaganza , there's nothing here to match that movie's intermittent moments of inspiration . 
0	i'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by vincent r . nebrida or the gutless direction by laurice guillen . 
0	the only reason you should see this movie is if you have a case of masochism and an hour and a half to blow . 
0	whatever about warning kids about the dangers of ouija boards , someone should dispense the same advice to film directors . 
0	as with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else . 
0	the irwins' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts . 
0	if routine action and jokes like this are your cup of tea , then pay your $8 and get ready for the big shear . this is one baaaaaaaaad movie .

0	ritchie may not have a novel thought in his head , but he knows how to pose madonna . 
0	the story , touching though it is , does not quite have enough emotional resonance or variety of incident to sustain a feature , and even at 85 minutes it feels a bit long . 
0	feels like the work of an artist who is simply tired -- of fighting the same fights , of putting the weight of the world on his shoulders , of playing with narrative form . 
0	while you have to admit it's semi-amusing to watch robert deniro belt out " when you're a jet , you're a jet all the way , " it's equally distasteful to watch him sing the lyrics to " tonight . " 
0	an opportunity missed . 
0	the whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it's trying to set the women's liberation movement back 20 years .

0	if you saw benigni's pinocchio at a public park , you'd grab your kids and run and then probably call the police . 
0	the animation is competent , and some of the gags are quite funny , but jonah . . . never shakes the oppressive , morally superior good-for-you quality that almost automatically accompanies didactic entertainment . 
0	the pace of the film is very slow ( for obvious reasons ) and that too becomes off-putting . 
0	mr . wollter and ms . seldhal give strong and convincing performances , but neither reaches into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion , grief and fear . 
0	shafer's feature doesn't offer much in terms of plot or acting . 
0	in his role of observer of the scene , lawrence sounds whiny and defensive , as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature . 
0	[t]he ideas of revolution #9 are more compelling than the execution
0	the film didn't convince me that calvin jr . 's barbershop represents some sort of beacon of hope in the middle of chicago's south side . 
0	what happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares ? 
0	despite some comic sparks , welcome to collinwood never catches fire . 
0	director george hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place . 
0	shows moments of promise but ultimately succumbs to cliches and pat storytelling . 
0	even accepting this in the right frame of mind can only provide it with so much leniency . 
0	some body is a shaky , uncertain film that nevertheless touches a few raw nerves . 
0	all the small moments and flashbacks don't add up to much more than trite observations on the human condition . 
0	[a] stale retread of the '53 original . 
0	one thing's for sureif george romero had directed this movie , it wouldn't have taken the protagonists a full hour to determine that in order to kill a zombie you must shoot it in the head . 
0	for dance completists only . 
0	one of the worst movies of the year . 
0	spreads itself too thin , leaving these actors , as well as the members of the commune , short of profound characterizations
0	it wouldn't matter so much that this arrogant richard pryor wannabe's routine is offensive , puerile and unimaginatively foul-mouthed if it was at least funny .

0	yo , it's the days of our lives meets electric boogaloo . 
0	inconsequential road-and-buddy pic . 
0	i liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it's too long and it goes nowhere . 
0	this little film is so slovenly done , so primitive in technique , that it can't really be called animation . 
0	makes 98 minutes feel like three hours . 
0	hawke's film , a boring , pretentious waste of nearly two hours , doesn't tell you anything except that the chelsea hotel today is populated by whiny , pathetic , starving and untalented artistes . 
0	aspires to the cracked lunacy of the adventures of buckaroo banzai , but thanks to an astonishingly witless script ends up more like the adventures of ford fairlane .

0	low comedy doesn't come much lower . 
0	appropriately cynical social commentary aside , #9 never quite ignites . 
0	it's crap on a leash--far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of joe dante's similarly styled gremlins . 
0	one of the most depressing movie-going experiences i can think of is to sit through about 90 minutes of a so-called 'comedy' and not laugh once . 
0	this is the kind of movie where the big scene is a man shot out of a cannon into a vat of ice cream . 
0	let's face it -- there aren't many reasons anyone would want to see crossroads if they're not big fans of teen pop kitten britney spears . 
0	a loud , brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy . 
0	an exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work , every bit as imperious as katzenberg's the prince of egypt from 1998 . 
0	insufferably naive . 
0	the movie is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue , just because it seems obligatory . 
0	the movie's vision of a white american zealously spreading a puritanical brand of christianity to south seas islanders is one only a true believer could relish . 
0	maid in manhattan proves that it's easier to change the sheets than to change hackneyed concepts when it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies .

0	ill-considered , unholy hokum . 
0	amazingly lame . 
0	 . . . the whole thing succeeded only in making me groggy . 
0	like most of jaglom's films , some of it is honestly affecting , but more of it seems contrived and secondhand .

0	forgettable , if good-hearted , movie . 
0	the film's most improbable feat ? it didn't go straight to video . 
0	 . . . about as exciting to watch as two last-place basketball teams playing one another on the final day of the season . 
0	the chateau . . . is less concerned with cultural and political issues than doting on its eccentric characters . 
0	cruel and inhuman cinematic punishment . . . simultaneously degrades its characters , its stars and its audience . 
0	it's not too fast and not too slow . it's not too racy and it's not too offensive . it's not too much of anything . 
0	the great pity is that those responsible didn't cut their losses  and ours  and retitle it the adventures of direct-to-video nash , and send it to its proper home . 
0	about as original as a gangster sweating bullets while worrying about a contract on his life . 
0	an empty shell of an epic rather than the real deal . 
0	we could have expected a little more human being , and a little less product . 
0	instead of using george and lucy's most obvious differences to ignite sparks , lawrence desperately looks elsewhere , seizing on george's haplessness and lucy's personality tics . 
0	whether quitting will prove absorbing to american audiences is debatable . 
0	becomes a bit of a mishmash : a tearjerker that doesn't and a thriller that won't . 
0	family togetherness takes a back seat to inter-family rivalry and workplace ambition&#133 ; whole subplots have no explanation or even plot relevance . 
0	grant isn't cary and bullock isn't katherine . 
0	like a fish that's lived too long , austin powers in goldmember has some unnecessary parts and is kinda wrong in places .

0	shyamalan should stop trying to please his mom . 
0	the entire movie is in need of a scented bath . 
0	i'm sorry to say that this should seal the deal - arnold is not , nor will he be , back . 
0	the story of trouble every day . . . is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult . 
0	a movie to forget
0	for all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , and its electronic expression through cyber culture , the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2 1/2-hour running time . 
0	enough is not a bad movie , just mediocre . the performances are so overstated , the effect comes off as self-parody . 
0	it looks good , but it is essentially empty . 
0	the film never finds its tone and several scenes run too long . 
0	the idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run . 
0	van wilder has a built-in audience , but only among those who are drying out from spring break and are still unconcerned about what they ingest . 
0	a complete waste of time . 
0	it's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby . 
0	do we really need another film that praises female self-sacrifice ? 
0	the major problem with windtalkers is that the bulk of the movie centers on the wrong character . 
0	tennessee williams by way of oprah's book club . 
0	so verbally flatfooted and so emotionally predictable or bland that it plays like the standard made-for-tv movie . 
0	the entire point of a shaggy dog story , of course , is that it goes nowhere , and this is classic nowheresville in every sense . 
0	stale and clichéd to a fault . 
0	this film is too busy hitting all of its assigned marks to take on any life of its own . 
0	watching junk like this induces a kind of abstract guilt , as if you were paying dues for good books unread , fine music never heard . 
0	the script feels as if it started to explore the obvious voyeuristic potential of 'hypertime' but then backed off when the producers saw the grosses for spy kids . 
0	starts off witty and sophisticated and you want to love it -- but filmmaker yvan attal quickly writes himself into a corner . 
0	some like it hot on the hardwood proves once again that a man in drag is not in and of himself funny . 
0	unfortunately , contrived plotting , stereotyped characters and woo's over-the-top instincts as a director undermine the moral dilemma at the movie's heart . 
0	witless and utterly pointless . 
0	when 'science fiction' takes advantage of the fact that its intended audience hasn't yet had much science , it does a disservice to the audience and to the genre . 
0	show me the mugging . 
0	represents something very close to the nadir of the thriller/horror genre . 
0	visually sumptuous but intellectually stultifying . 
0	as a feature-length film , it wears out its welcome as tryingly as the title character . 
0	a guilty pleasure at best , and not worth seeing unless you want to laugh at it . 
0	a sleep-inducing thriller with a single twist that everyone except the characters in it can see coming a mile away . 
0	with a " spy kids " sequel opening next week , why bother with a contemptible imitator starring a " snl " has-been acting like an 8-year-old channeling roberto benigni ? 
0	it's just rather leaden and dull . 
0	lacks the visual flair and bouncing bravado that characterizes better hip-hop clips and is content to recycle images and characters that were already tired 10 years ago . 
0	'pocas ideas interesantes , un final pseudo místico que no corresponde al tono general del filme y que deja una sensación de inconformidad que hace pensar más de una vez si vale la pena ir a la taquilla y reclamar el precio del boleto . '
0	statham employs an accent that i think is supposed to be an attempt at hardass american but sometimes just lapses into unhidden british . 
0	instead of trying to bust some blondes , [diggs] should be probing why a guy with his talent ended up in a movie this bad . 
0	initial strangeness inexorably gives way to rote sentimentality and mystical tenderness becomes narrative expedience . 
0	de ayala is required to supply too much of the energy in a film that is , overall , far too staid for its subject matter . 
0	dismally dull sci-fi comedy . 
0	there's surely something wrong with a comedy where the only belly laughs come from the selection of outtakes tacked onto the end credits . 
0	when one hears harry shearer is going to make his debut as a film director , one would hope for the best
0	the leads we are given here are simply too bland to be interesting . 
0	[toback's] fondness for fancy split-screen , stuttering editing and pompous references to wittgenstein and kirkegaard . . . blends uneasily with the titillating material . 
0	adam sandler's 8 crazy nights is 75 wasted minutes of sandler as the voice-over hero in columbia pictures' perverse idea of an animated holiday movie . 
0	essentially " fatal attraction " remade for viewers who were in diapers when the original was released in 1987 . . . . this story gets sillier , not scarier , as it goes along . . . 
0	even a hardened voyeur would require the patience of job to get through this interminable , shapeless documentary about the swinging subculture . 
0	the film's hero is a bore and his innocence soon becomes a questionable kind of inexcusable dumb innocence . 
0	a singularly off-putting romantic comedy . 
0	this is an exercise not in biography but in hero worship . 
0	it all comes down to whether you can tolerate leon barlow . i can't . 
0	in the spirit of the season , i assign one bright shining star to roberto benigni's pinocchio -- but i guarantee that no wise men will be following after it . 
0	check your brain and your secret agent decoder ring at the door because you don't want to think too much about what's going on . the movie does has some entertainment value - how much depends on how well you like chris rock . 
0	a movie that seems motivated more by a desire to match mortarboards with dead poets society and good will hunting than by its own story . 
0	a culture clash comedy only half as clever as it thinks it is . 
0	the logic of it all will be greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie's rude and crude humor . 
0	as self-aware movies go , who is cletis tout ? is clever enough , though thin writing proves its undoing . 
0	starts out strongly before quickly losing its focus , point and purpose in a mess of mixed messages , over-blown drama and bruce willis with a scar . 
0	 . . . a fascinating curiosity piece -- fascinating , that is , for about ten minutes . after that it becomes long and tedious like a classroom play in a college history course . 
0	director jay russell weighs down his capricious fairy-tale with heavy sentiment and lightweight meaning . 
0	there are many things that solid acting can do for a movie , but crafting something promising from a mediocre screenplay is not one of them . 
0	its screenplay serves as auto-critique , and its clumsiness as its own most damning censure . 
0	at times , it actually hurts to watch . 
0	nemesis suffers from a paunchy midsection , several plodding action sequences and a wickedly undramatic central theme . 
0	the jokes are telegraphed so far in advance they must have been lost in the mail . 
0	[tries] to parody a genre that's already a joke in the united states . the movie is the equivalent of french hip-hop , which also seems to play on a 10-year delay . 
0	a beyond-lame satire , teddy bears' picnic ranks among the most pitiful directing debuts by an esteemed writer-actor . 
0	long before it's over , you'll be thinking of 51 ways to leave this loser . 
0	i've never seen ( a remake ) do anything as stomach-turning as the way adam sandler's new movie rapes , pillages and incinerates frank capra's classic . . . 
0	hollywood's answer to an air ball . 
0	and people make fun of me for liking showgirls</> . 
0	such a wildly uneven hit-and-miss enterprise , you can't help suspecting that it was improvised on a day-to-day basis during production . 
0	a weird little movie that's amusing enough while you watch it , offering fine acting moments and pungent insights into modern l . a . 's show-biz and media subcultures . but it doesn't leave you with much . 
0	i'm convinced i could keep a family of five blind , crippled , amish people alive in this situation better than these british soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking . 
0	like mike is a slight and uninventive movie : like the exalted michael jordan referred to in the title , many can aspire but none can equal . 
0	there is nothing funny in this every-joke-has- been-told-a- thousand-times- before movie . 
0	always destined to be measured against anthony asquith's acclaimed 1952 screen adaptation . 
0	this is standard crime drama fare . . . instantly forgettable and thoroughly dull . 
0	there's some outrageously creative action in the transporter . . . [b]ut by the time frank parachutes down onto a moving truck , it's just another cartoon with an unstoppable superman . 
0	one of those based-on-truth stories that persuades you , with every scene , that it could never really have happened this way . 
0	from its nauseating spinning credits sequence to a very talented but underutilized supporting cast , bartleby squanders as much as it gives out . 
0	yet another genre exercise , gangster no . 1 is as generic as its title . 
0	despite the holes in the story and the somewhat predictable plot , moments of the movie caused me to jump in my chair . . . 
0	there's an admirable rigor to jimmy's relentless anger , and to the script's refusal of a happy ending , but as those monologues stretch on and on , you realize there's no place for this story to go but down . 
0	once again , the intelligence of gay audiences has been grossly underestimated , and a meaty plot and well-developed characters have been sacrificed for skin and flash that barely fizzle . 
0	a lightweight , uneven action comedy that freely mingles french , japanese and hollywood cultures .

0	such a fine idea for a film , and such a stultifying , lifeless execution .

0	rarely has sex on screen been so aggressively anti-erotic . 
0	a dull , inconsistent , dishonest female bonding picture . 
0	so much about the film is loopy and ludicrous . . . that it could have been a hoot in a bad-movie way if the laborious pacing and endless exposition had been tightened . 
0	a disappointment for a movie that should have been the ultimate imax trip . 
0	does little to elaborate the conceit of setting this blood-soaked tragedy of murderous ambition in the era of richard nixon . 
0	this sade is hardly a perverse , dangerous libertine and agitator -- which would have made for better drama . he's just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery , and the film seems as deflated as he does . 
0	the film's needlessly opaque intro takes its doe-eyed crudup out of pre-9/11 new york and onto a cross-country road trip of the homeric kind . 
0	it's as if a bored cage spent the duration of the film's shooting schedule waiting to scream : " got aids yet ? " 
0	in a strange way , egoyan has done too much . he's worked too hard on this movie .

0	a shoddy male hip hop fantasy filled with guns , expensive cars , lots of naked women and rocawear clothing . 
0	to the filmmakers , ivan is a prince of a fellow , but he comes across as shallow and glib though not mean-spirited , and there's no indication that he's been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit . 
0	this is a movie filled with unlikable , spiteful idiots ; whether or not their friendship is salvaged makes no difference in the least . 
0	it's as if allen , at 66 , has stopped challenging himself . 
0	scotland , pa is entirely too straight-faced to transcend its clever concept . 
0	a movie that the less charitable might describe as a castrated cross between highlander and lolita .

0	there's little to recommend snow dogs , unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity . 
0	it's deep-sixed by a compulsion to catalog every bodily fluids gag in there's something about mary and devise a parallel clone-gag . 
0	the film rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes -- it's insanely violent and very graphic . 
0	sorority boys , which is as bad at it is cruel , takes every potential laugh and stiletto-stomps the life out of it . 
0	here the love scenes all end in someone screaming . maybe there's a metaphor here , but figuring it out wouldn't make trouble every day any better .

0	fans of so-bad-they're-good cinema may find some fun in this jumbled mess . 
0	weiss and speck never make a convincing case for the relevance of these two 20th-century footnotes .

0	presents nothing special and , until the final act , nothing overtly disagreeable . 
0	the most excruciating 86 minutes one might sit through this summer that do not involve a dentist drill . 
0	was that movie nothing more than a tepid exercise in trotting out a formula that worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz ? 
0	it goes on for too long and bogs down in a surfeit of characters and unnecessary subplots . 
0	it's absolutely amazing how first-time director kevin donovan managed to find something new to add to the canon of chan . make chan's action sequences boring . 
0	you . . . get a sense of good intentions derailed by a failure to seek and strike just the right tone . 
0	'in this poor remake of such a well loved classic , parker exposes the limitations of his skill and the basic flaws in his vision . '
0	it's the movie equivalent of a sweaty old guy in a rain coat shopping for cheap porn . 
0	the film's final hour , where nearly all the previous unseen material resides , is unconvincing soap opera that tornatore was right to cut . 
0	the movie does such an excellent job of critiquing itself at every faltering half-step of its development that criticizing feels more like commiserating . 
0	i found it slow , predictable and not very amusing . 
0	director yu seems far more interested in gross-out humor than in showing us well-thought stunts or a car chase that we haven't seen 10 , 000 times . 
0	viewers will need all the luck they can muster just figuring out who's who in this pretentious mess . 
0	a pint-sized 'goodfellas' designed to appeal to the younger set , it's not a very good movie in any objective sense , but it does mostly hold one's interest . 
0	get out your pooper-scoopers . 
0	while the material is slight , the movie is better than you might think . 
0	it's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and i think even fans of sandler's comic taste may find it uninteresting . 
0	sheridan seems terrified of the book's irreverent energy , and scotches most of its élan , humor , bile , and irony . 
0	more busy than exciting , more frantic than involving , more chaotic than entertaining . 
0	there are more shots of children smiling for the camera than typical documentary footage which hurts the overall impact of the film . it's makes a better travelogue than movie . 
0	 . . . really horrible drek . 
0	it's as if solondz had two ideas for two movies , couldn't really figure out how to flesh either out , so he just slopped em together here . 
0	the fourth in a series that i'll bet most parents had thought --hoped ! -- was a fad that had long since vanished . 
0	it's a long way from orwell's dark , intelligent warning cry [1984] to the empty stud knockabout of equilibrium , and what once was conviction is now affectation . 
0	its premise is smart , but the execution is pretty weary . 
0	the holiday message of the 37-minute santa vs . the snowman leaves a lot to be desired . 
0	more precious than perspicacious
0	if you saw it on tv , you'd probably turn it off , convinced that you had already seen that movie . 
0	[t]he script isn't up to the level of the direction , nor are the uneven performances by the cast members , who seem bound and determined to duplicate bela lugosi's now-cliched vampire accent . 
0	if this is cinema , i pledge allegiance to cagney and lacey . 
0	enigma looks great , has solid acting and a neat premise . yet why it fails is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma . 
0	most of the characters come off as pantomimesque sterotypes . 
0	starts promisingly but disintegrates into a dreary , humorless soap opera . 
0	while there's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the elizabethans ( as well as rank frustration from those in the know about rubbo's dumbed-down tactics ) , much ado about something is an amicable endeavor . 
0	it's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick . 
0	most of the film feels conceived and shot on the fly -- like between lunch breaks for shearer's radio show and his simpson voice-overs . 
0	perry's good and his is an interesting character , but " serving sara " hasn't much more to serve than silly fluff . nor is it a romantic comedy . 
0	culkin turns his character into what is basically an anti-harry potter -- right down to the gryffindor scarf . 
0	memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid and , by extension , its surprises limp and its resolutions ritual . 
0	it's a documentary that says that the alternate sexuality meant to set you free may require so much relationship maintenance that celibacy can start looking good . 
0	in the not-too-distant future , movies like ghost ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds . right now , they're merely signposts marking the slow , lingering death of imagination . 
0	an intriguing near-miss . 
0	the movie's biggest shocks come from seeing former nymphette juliette lewis playing a salt-of-the-earth mommy named minnie and watching slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig no respectable halloween costume shop would ever try to sell . 
0	like most movies about the pitfalls of bad behavior . . . circuit gets drawn into the party .

0	piccoli's performance is amazing , yes , but the symbols of loss and denial and life-at-arm's-length in the film seem irritatingly transparent . 
0	starts out mediocre , spirals downward , and thuds to the bottom of the pool with an utterly incompetent conclusion . 
0	nicolas cage isn't the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray , and this movie won't create a ruffle in what is already an erratic career . 
0	it lacks the compassion , good-natured humor and the level of insight that made [eyre's] first film something of a sleeper success . 
0	the result is good gossip , entertainingly delivered , yet with a distinctly musty odour , its expiry date long gone .

0	unlike trey parker , sandler doesn't understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself . 
0	a fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them . 
0	an empty , purposeless exercise . 
0	earnest and tentative even when it aims to shock . 
0	haneke's script ( from elfriede jelinek's novel ) is contrived , unmotivated , and psychologically unpersuasive , with an inconclusive ending . 
0	a sometimes incisive and sensitive portrait that is undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering toward melodrama . 
0	those 24-and-unders looking for their own caddyshack to adopt as a generational signpost may have to keep on looking . 
0	a distinctly mixed bag , the occasional bursts of sharp writing alternating with lots of sloppiness and the obligatory moments of sentimental ooze .

0	the feature-length stretch . . . strains the show's concept . 
0	this slender plot feels especially thin stretched over the nearly 80-minute running time . 
0	a film that will probably please people already fascinated by behan but leave everyone else yawning with admiration . 
0	davis the performer is plenty fetching enough , but she needs to shake up the mix , and work in something that doesn't feel like a half-baked stand-up routine . 
0	the densest distillation of roberts' movies ever made . 
0	ultimately , the film never recovers from the clumsy cliché of the ugly american abroad , and the too-frosty exterior ms . paltrow employs to authenticate her british persona is another liability . 
0	a handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on pbs than a night out at an amc . 
0	tom green and an ivy league college should never appear together on a marquee , especially when the payoff is an unschooled comedy like stealing harvard , which fails to keep 80 minutes from seeming like 800 . 
0	 ( it ) highlights not so much the crime lord's messianic bent , but spacey's . 
0	master of disguise runs for only 71 minutes and feels like three hours . 
0	a reworking of die hard and cliffhanger but it's nowhere near as exciting as either . 
0	suffers from unlikable characters and a self-conscious sense of its own quirky hipness . 
0	a film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity . 
0	fessenden continues to do interesting work , and it would be nice to see what he could make with a decent budget . but the problem with wendigo , for all its effective moments , isn't really one of resources . 
0	spirit is a visual treat , and it takes chances that are bold by studio standards , but it lacks a strong narrative . 
0	it stars schticky chris rock and stolid anthony hopkins , who seem barely in the same movie . their contrast is neither dramatic nor comic -- it's just a weird fizzle . 
0	this is a children's film in the truest sense . it's packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message , so it's great for the kids . parents , on the other hand , will be ahead of the plot at all times , and there isn't enough clever innuendo to fil
0	the niftiest trick perpetrated by the importance of being earnest is the alchemical transmogrification of wilde into austen--and a hollywood-ized austen at that . 
0	tykwer's surface flash isn't just a poor fit with kieslowski's lyrical pessimism ; it completely contradicts everything kieslowski's work aspired to , including the condition of art . 
0	ice age is the first computer-generated feature cartoon to feel like other movies , and that makes for some glacial pacing early on . 
0	too slick and manufactured to claim street credibility . 
0	cherry orchard is badly edited , often awkwardly directed and suffers from the addition of a wholly unnecessary pre-credit sequence designed to give some of the characters a 'back story . '
0	what ensues are much blood-splattering , mass drug-induced bowel evacuations , and none-too-funny commentary on the cultural distinctions between americans and brits . 
0	a dark comedy that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so . the movie is without intent . 
0	visually exciting sci-fi film which suffers from a lackluster screenplay . 
0	while hollywood ending has its share of belly laughs ( including a knockout of a closing line ) , the movie winds up feeling like a great missed opportunity . 
0	if the full monty was a freshman fluke , lucky break is [cattaneo] sophomore slump . 
0	 sandra bullock and hugh grant make a great team , but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip . 
0	allegiance to chekhov , which director michael cacoyannis displays with somber earnestness in the new adaptation of the cherry orchard , is a particularly vexing handicap . 
0	you expect more from director michael apted ( enigma ) and screenwriter nicholas kazan ( reversal of fortune ) than this cliche pileup . 
0	the first mistake , i suspect , is casting shatner as a legendary professor and kunis as a brilliant college student--where's pauly shore as the rocket scientist ? 
0	the dramatic scenes are frequently unintentionally funny , and the action sequences -- clearly the main event -- are surprisingly uninvolving . 
0	replacing john carpenter's stylish tracking shots is degraded , handheld blair witch video-cam footage . of all the halloween's , this is the most visually unappealing . 
0	it has the requisite faux-urban vibe and hotter-two-years-ago rap and r&b names and references . 
0	despite its dry wit and compassion , the film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing . 
0	 . . . feels as if ( there's ) a choke leash around your neck so director nick cassavetes can give it a good , hard yank whenever he wants you to feel something . 
0	attal pushes too hard to make this a comedy or serious drama . he seems to want both , but succeeds in making neither . 
0	i could have used my two hours better watching being john malkovich again . 
0	it's not a bad plot ; but , unfortunately , the movie is nowhere near as refined as all the classic dramas it borrows from . 
0	flat , misguided comedy . 
0	girlfriends are bad , wives are worse and babies are the kiss of death in this bitter italian comedy . 
0	the only young people who possibly will enjoy it are infants . . . who might be distracted by the movie's quick movements and sounds . 
0	the film boasts at least a few good ideas and features some decent performances , but the result is disappointing . 
0	no such thing breaks no new ground and treads old turf like a hippopotamus ballerina . 
0	unfortunately , neither sendak nor the directors are particularly engaging or articulate . 
0	a wishy-washy melodramatic movie that shows us plenty of sturm und drung , but explains its characters' decisions only unsatisfactorily . 
0	bang ! zoom ! it's actually pretty funny , but in all the wrong places . 
0	lurid and less than lucid work . 
0	a wannabe comedy of manners about a brainy prep-school kid with a mrs . robinson complex founders on its own preciousness -- and squanders its beautiful women . 
0	at a brief 42 minutes , we need more x and less blab . 
0	if anything , see it for karen black , who camps up a storm as a fringe feminist conspiracy theorist named dirty dick . 
0	this 90-minute dud could pass for mike tyson's e ! true hollywood story . 
0	this is surely one of the most frantic , virulent and foul-natured christmas season pics ever delivered by a hollywood studio . 
0	once the expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand , even the funniest idea isn't funny . 
0	a porn film without the sex scenes . 
0	the connected stories of breitbart and hanussen are actually fascinating , but the filmmaking in invincible is such that the movie does not do them justice . 
0	a depressingly retrograde , 'post-feminist' romantic comedy that takes an astonishingly condescending attitude toward women . 
0	return to never land is much more p . c . than the original version ( no more racist portraits of indians , for instance ) , but the excitement is missing . 
0	by the end , you just don't care whether that cold-hearted snake petrovich ( that would be reno ) gets his comeuppance . just bring on the battle bots , please ! 
0	while it's all quite tasteful to look at , the attention process tends to do a little fleeing of its own . 
0	broder's screenplay is shallow , offensive and redundant , with pitifully few real laughs . 
0	yes they can swim , the title is merely anne-sophie birot's off-handed way of saying girls find adolescence difficult to wade through . 
0	don michael paul uses quick-cuts , ( very ) large shadows and wide-angle shots taken from a distance to hide the liberal use of a body double ( for seagal ) . 
0	slow , silly and unintentionally hilarious . 
0	the sweetest thing leaves a bitter taste . 
0	in a big corner office in hell , satan is throwing up his hands in surrender , is firing his r&d people , and has decided he will just screen the master of disguise 24/7 . 
0	for something as splendid-looking as this particular film , the viewer expects something special but instead gets [sci-fi] rehash . 
0	a thriller without a lot of thrills . 
0	this stuck pig of a movie flails limply between bizarre comedy and pallid horror . 
0	ah , the travails of metropolitan life ! alas , another breathless movie about same ! 
0	in moonlight mile , no one gets shut out of the hug cycle . 
0	though uniformly well acted , especially by young ballesta and galan ( a first-time actor ) , writer/director achero manas's film is schematic and obvious . 
0	done in mostly by a weak script that can't support the epic treatment . 
0	despite its visual virtuosity , 'naqoyqatsi' is banal in its message and the choice of material to convey it . 
0	slap her - she's not funny ! no french people were harmed during the making of this movie , but they were insulted and the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half . 
0	though its rather routine script is loaded with familiar situations , the movie has a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should . 
0	 " one look at a girl in tight pants and big tits and you turn stupid ? " um . . isn't that the basis for the entire plot ? 
0	 " not really as bad as you might think ! " 
0	strident and inelegant in its 'message-movie' posturing . 
0	one regards reign of fire with awe . what a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea . 
0	it has the right approach and the right opening premise , but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material . 
0	its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie's presentation , which is way too stagy . 
0	seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director's experiment is a successful one . 
0	the plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from start to finish . 
0	i suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the dvd . 
0	an unfortunate title for a film that has nothing endearing about it . 
0	ninety minutes of viva castro ! can be as tiresome as 9 seconds of jesse helms' anti- castro rhetoric , which are included
0	comes off as a long , laborious whine , the bellyaching of a paranoid and unlikable man . 
0	it just goes to show , an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller . 
0	in a 102-minute film , aaliyah gets at most 20 minutes of screen time . . . . most viewers will wish there had been more of the " queen " and less of the " damned . " 
0	hopelessly inane , humorless and under-inspired . 
0	kapur fails to give his audience a single character worth rooting for ( or worth rooting against , for that matter ) . 
0	it reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it . 
0	none of this has the suavity or classical familiarity of bond , but much of it is good for a laugh . the problem with " xxx " is that its own action isn't very effective . 
0	a great script brought down by lousy direction . same guy with both hats . big mistake . 
0	a mediocre exercise in target demographics , unaware that it's the butt of its own joke . 
0	director kevin bray excels in breaking glass and marking off the " miami vice " checklist of power boats , latin music and dog tracks . he doesn't , however , deliver nearly enough of the show's trademark style and flash . 
0	in gleefully , thumpingly hyperbolic terms , it covers just about every cliche in the compendium about crass , jaded movie types and the phony baloney movie biz . 
0	the spalding gray equivalent of a teen gross-out comedy . 
0	perhaps even the slc high command found writer-director mitch davis's wall of kitsch hard going . 
0	according to wendigo , 'nature' loves the members of the upper class almost as much as they love themselves . 
0	an encouraging effort from mccrudden
0	the romance between the leads isn't as compelling or as believable as it should be . 
0	if i could have looked into my future and saw how bad this movie was , i would go back and choose to skip it . fortunately , you still have that option . 
0	supposedly authentic account of a historical event that's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment . 
0	adroit but finally a trifle flat , mad love doesn't galvanize its outrage the way , say , jane campion might have done , but at least it possesses some . 
0	to blandly go where we went 8 movies ago . . . 
0	a slow-moving police-procedural thriller that takes its title all too literally . 
0	this u-boat doesn't have a captain . 
0	with nary a glimmer of self-knowledge , [crane] becomes more specimen than character -- and auto focus remains a chilly , clinical lab report . 
0	this one aims for the toilet and scores a direct hit . 
0	dull , a road-trip movie that's surprisingly short of both adventure and song . 
0	i walked away not really know who " they " were , what " they " looked like . why " they " were here and what " they " wanted and quite honestly , i didn't care . 
0	predictably melodramatic . 
0	after several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of jerry bruckheimer productions , especially because half past dead is like the rock on a wal-mart budget . 
0	a relatively effective little potboiler until its absurd , contrived , overblown , and entirely implausible finale . 
0	the country bears wastes an exceptionally good idea . but the movie that doesn't really deliver for country music fans or for family audiences
0	adults will certainly want to spend their time in the theater thinking up grocery lists and ways to tell their kids how not to act like pinocchio . as for children , they won't enjoy the movie at all . 
0	 . . . you can be forgiven for realizing that you've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already . 
0	too bad writer-director adam rifkin situates it all in a plot as musty as one of the golden eagle's carpets . 
0	it's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another . 
0	the movie is genial but never inspired , and little about it will stay with you . 
0	the movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as jules verne's '20 , 000 leagues under the sea' and the george pal version of h . g . wells' 'the time machine . ' but its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless . 
0	despite the opulent lushness of every scene , the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings . 
0	even after 90 minutes of playing opposite each other bullock and grant still look ill at ease sharing the same scene . what should have been a painless time-killer becomes instead a grating endurance test . 
0	a bland , obnoxious 88-minute infomercial for universal studios and its ancillary products . 
0	 . . little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as sci-fi generic . 
0	the movie strains to stay on the light , comic side of the issue , despite the difficulty of doing so when dealing with the destruction of property and , potentially , of life itself . 
0	the master of disguise is awful . it's pauly shore awful . don't say you weren't warned . 
0	disappointing in comparison to other recent war moviesor any other john woo flick for that matter . 
0	the entire movie is filled with deja vu moments . 
0	'opening up' the play more has partly closed it down . 
0	what [frei] gives us . . . is a man who uses the damage of war -- far more often than the warfare itself -- to create the kind of art shots that fill gallery shows . 
0	an ugly , revolting movie . 
0	the film is way too full of itself ; it's stuffy and pretentious in a give-me-an-oscar kind of way . 
0	the movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn , and the nicest thing i can say is that i can't remember a single name responsible for it . 
0	watching " ending " is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor's garage sale . you can't believe anyone would really buy this stuff . 
0	certainly beautiful to look at , but its not very informative about its titular character and no more challenging than your average television biopic . 
0	it desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time . 
0	the skills of a calculus major at m . i . t . are required to balance all the formulaic equations in the long-winded heist comedy who is cletis tout ? 
0	from the choppy editing to the annoying score to 'special effects' by way of replacing objects in a character's hands below the camera line , " besotted " is misbegotten
0	my advice is to skip the film and pick up the soundtrack . 
0	a film that presents an interesting , even sexy premise then ruins itself with too many contrivances and goofy situations . 
0	filled with low-brow humor , gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard for life . 
0	directed in a flashy , empty sub-music video style by a director so self-possessed he actually adds a period to his first name
0	the 70-year-old godard has become , to judge from in praise of love , the sort of bitter old crank who sits behind his light meter and harangues the supposed injustices of the artistic world-at-large without doing all that much to correct them . 
0	an unsophisticated sci-fi drama that takes itself all too seriously . 
0	solondz is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision , but that vision is beginning to feel , if not morally bankrupt , at least terribly monotonous . 
0	harvard man is a semi-throwback , a reminiscence without nostalgia or sentimentality . 
0	supposedly based upon real , or at least soberly reported incidents , the film ends with a large human tragedy . alas , getting there is not even half the interest . 
0	while hoffman's performance is great , the subject matter goes nowhere . 
0	the smash 'em-up , crash 'em-up , shoot 'em-up ending comes out of nowhere substituting mayhem for suspense . 
0	deuces wild treads heavily into romeo and juliet/west side story territory , where it plainly has no business going . 
0	hart's war seems to want to be a character study , but apparently can't quite decide which character . 
0	theological matters aside , the movie is so clumsily sentimental and ineptly directed it may leave you speaking in tongues . 
0	this latest installment of the horror film franchise that is apparently as invulnerable as its trademark villain has arrived for an incongruous summer playoff , demonstrating yet again that the era of the intelligent , well-made b movie is long gone . 
0	novak contemplates a heartland so overwhelmed by its lack of purpose that it seeks excitement in manufactured high drama . 
0	been there , done that , liked it much better the first time around - when it was called the professional . 
0	the film is all over the place , really . it dabbles all around , never gaining much momentum . 
0	the beautiful , unusual music is this film's chief draw , but its dreaminess may lull you to sleep . 
0	the action quickly sinks into by-the-numbers territory . 
0	forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining . 
0	when [reno] lets her radical flag fly , taking angry potshots at george w . bush , henry kissinger , larry king , et al . , reno devolves into a laugh-free lecture . 
0	such a premise is ripe for all manner of lunacy , but kaufman and gondry rarely seem sure of where it should go . 
0	burns' fifth beer-soaked film feels in almost every possible way -- from the writing and direction to the soggy performances -- tossed off . 
0	'es en verdad una pena que mandoki esté realizando cintas tan malas desde hace algún tiempo , pues talento tiene , pero quién sabe dónde lo tiene escondido . '
0	while this one gets off with a good natured warning , future lizard endeavors will need to adhere more closely to the laws of laughter
0	another boorish movie from the i-heard-a-joke- at-a-frat-party school of screenwriting . 
0	too much of the movie feels contrived , as if the filmmakers were worried the story wouldn't work without all those gimmicks . 
0	it's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie . and it's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it . 
0	the ethos of the chelsea hotel may shape hawke's artistic aspirations , but he hasn't yet coordinated his own dv poetry with the beat he hears in his soul . 
0	the sight of the name bruce willis brings to mind images of a violent battlefield action picture , but the film has a lot more on its mind--maybe too much . 
0	why sit through a crummy , wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one ? 
0	the obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old hanna-barbera charm . 
0	exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as kerrigan's platinum-blonde hair . 
0	the movie's downfall is to substitute plot for personality . it doesn't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events . 
0	all mood and no movie . 
0	press the delete key . 
0	simone is not a bad film . it just doesn't have anything really interesting to say . 
0	once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy , the film becomes predictably conventional . 
0	 . . . hopefully it'll be at the dollar theatres by the time christmas rolls around . wait to see it then . 
0	there's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer . or for the year , for that matter . 
0	lacks the spirit of the previous two , and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck . 
0	this hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on hopkins' inclination to play hannibal lecter again , even though harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book . 
0	death to smoochy tells a moldy-oldie , not-nearly -as-nasty -as-it- thinks-it-is joke . over and over again . 
0	the threat implied in the title pokémon 4ever is terrifying  like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming . 
0	the film never gets over its own investment in conventional arrangements , in terms of love , age , gender , race , and class . 
0	to call this film a lump of coal would only be to flatter it . 
0	entertainment more disposable than hanna-barbera's half-hour cartoons ever were . 
0	the film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original new testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries . 
0	by the end of it all i sort of loved the people onscreen , even though i could not stand them . perhaps the film should be seen as a conversation starter . it's not an easy one to review . 
0	at best this is a film for the under-7 crowd . but it would be better to wait for the video . and a very rainy day . 
0	the whole talking-animal thing is grisly . 
0	never again , while nothing special , is pleasant , diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction . 
0	wouldn't it be funny if a bunch of allied soldiers went undercover as women in a german factory during world war ii ? um , no . but here's a movie about it anyway . 
0	has not so much been written as assembled , frankenstein-like , out of other , marginally better shoot-em-ups . 
0	the punch lines that miss , unfortunately , outnumber the hits by three-to-one . but death to smoochy keeps firing until the bitter end . 
0	mushes the college-friends genre ( the big chill ) together with the contrivances and overwrought emotion of soap operas . 
0	showtime's starry cast could be both an asset and a detriment . those who trek to the 'plex predisposed to like it probably will enjoy themselves . but ticket-buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as mr . de niro . 
0	a determined , ennui-hobbled slog that really doesn't have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird . 
0	too daft by half . . . but supremely good natured . 
0	fails in making this character understandable , in getting under her skin , in exploring motivation . . . well before the end , the film grows as dull as its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care . 
0	it's a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes . . . finally seem so impersonal or even shallow . 
0	woody , what happened ? 
0	juliette binoche's sand is vivacious , but it's hard to sense that powerhouse of 19th-century prose behind her childlike smile . 
0	it's supposed to be post-feminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on oprah . 
0	you can tell almost immediately that welcome to collinwood isn't going to jell . 
0	throughout all the tumult , a question comes to mind : so why is this so boring ? 
0	cattaneo reworks the formula that made the full monty a smashing success . . . but neglects to add the magic that made it all work . 
0	routine and rather silly . 
0	a rip-off twice removed , modeled after [seagal's] earlier copycat under siege , sometimes referred to as die hard on a boat . 
0	totally overwrought , deeply biased , and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe are the greatest musicians of all time . 
0	you can practically hear george orwell turning over . 
0	behan's memoir is great material for a film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best irish sense -- but sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance . 
0	while holm is terrific as both men and hjejle quite appealing , the film fails to make the most out of the intriguing premise . 
0	lazy filmmaking , with the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it's compelling . 
0	if it were any more of a turkey , it would gobble in dolby digital stereo . if nothing else , " rollerball " 2002 may go down in cinema history as the only movie ever in which the rest of the cast was outshined by ll cool j . 
0	a movie that falls victim to frazzled wackiness and frayed satire . 
0	how do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any ? on the evidence before us , the answer is clear : not easily and , in the end , not well enough . 
0	the film's trailer also looked like crap , so crap is what i was expecting . 
0	more trifle than triumph . 
0	the movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction . 
0	festers in just such a dungpile that you'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you . 
0	lyne's latest , the erotic thriller unfaithful , further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded . 
0	it sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that's more or less how it plays out . 
0	rumor , a muddled drama about coming to terms with death , feels impersonal , almost generic . 
0	report card : doesn't live up to the exalted tagline - there's definite room for improvement . doesn't deserve a passing grade ( even on a curve ) . 
0	the pacing is deadly , the narration helps little and naipaul , a juicy writer , is negated . 
0	as his circle of friends keeps getting smaller one of the characters in long time dead says 'i'm telling you , this is f * * * ed' . maybe he was reading the minds of the audience . 
0	 . . . if it had been only half-an-hour long or a tv special , the humor would have been fast and furious-- at ninety minutes , it drags . 
0	bean drops the ball too many times . . . hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay . 
0	a well-acted , but one-note film . 
0	blood work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from eastwood's dirty harry period . 
0	the movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications . 
0	[lee] treats his audience the same way that jim brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects . and lee seems just as expectant of an adoring , wide-smiling reception . 
0	there's not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue . 
0	one of the worst movies of the year . . . . watching it was painful . 
0	a era do gelo diverte , mas não convence . É um passatempo descompromissado  e só . 
0	no amount of burning , blasting , stabbing , and shooting can hide a weak script . 
0	it's an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise . 
0	nearly all the fundamentals you take for granted in most films are mishandled here . 
0	the armenian genocide deserves a more engaged and honest treatment . 
0	earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner . 
0	ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of louis begley's source novel ( about schmidt ) and an old payne screenplay . 
0	the exploitative , clumsily staged violence overshadows everything , including most of the actors . 
0	we started to wonder if  some unpaid intern had just typed 'chris rock , ' 'anthony hopkins' and 'terrorists' into some univac-like script machine . 
0	even when crush departs from the 4w formula . . . it feels like a glossy rehash . 
0	more likely to have you scratching your head than hiding under your seat . 
0	bears is even worse than i imagined a movie ever could be . 
0	when you find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie , you know the picture is in trouble . 
0	this is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives . 
0	marinated in clichés and mawkish dialogue . 
0	whether it's the worst movie of 2002 , i can't say for sure : memories of rollerball have faded , and i skipped country bears . but this new jangle of noise , mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title . 
0	[a] boldly stroked , luridly coloured , uni-dimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain . 
0	not once in the rush to save the day did i become very involved in the proceedings ; to me , it was just a matter of 'eh . '
0	rollerball is as bad as you think , and worse than you can imagine . 
0	the first question to ask about bad company is why anthony hopkins is in it . we assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low . 
0	not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general . it merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them . 
0	shame on writer/director vicente aranda for making a florid biopic about mad queens , obsessive relationships , and rampant adultery so dull . 
0	suffers from a decided lack of creative storytelling . 
0	violent , vulgar and forgettably entertaining . 
0	nothing happens , and it happens to flat characters . 
0	with a completely predictable plot , you'll swear that you've seen it all before , even if you've never come within a mile of the longest yard . 
0	remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ? when the twist endings were actually surprising ? when the violence actually shocked ? when the heroes were actually under 40 ? sadly , as blood work proves , that was a long , long time ago . 
0	blue crush has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky " pretty woman " retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought . 
0	this movie plays like an extended dialogue exercise in retard 101 . 
0	what we get in feardotcom is more like something from a bad clive barker movie . in other words , it's badder than bad . 
0	if they broke out into elaborate choreography , singing and finger snapping it might have held my attention , but as it stands i kept looking for the last exit from brooklyn . 
0	a sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like the ghost and mr . chicken . 
0	a small independent film suffering from a severe case of hollywood-itis . 
0	where the film falters is in its tone . 
0	the story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head . 
0	ultimately , sarah's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness . 
0	it's supposed to be a humorous , all-too-human look at how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength -- but it never quite adds up . 
0	feels more like a rejected x-files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real-life happening . 
0	some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create ultimate thrills . men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance -- it's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as whiffle-ball epic . 
0	an enigmatic film that's too clever for its own good , it's a conundrum not worth solving . 
0	a zombie movie in every sense of the word--mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious . 
0	rashomon-for-dipsticks tale . 
0	a film that clearly means to preach exclusively to the converted . 
0	it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that . 
0	definitely a crowd-pleaser , but then , so was the roman colosseum . 
0	certainly not a good movie , but it wasn't horrible either . 
0	although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful . 
0	the result is so tame that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel . 
0	it appears to have been modeled on the worst revenge-of-the-nerds clichés the filmmakers could dredge up . 
0	nothing but an episode of smackdown ! in period costume and with a bigger budget . 
0	it takes you somewhere you're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface ( and exotic dancing ) it's surprisingly old-fashioned . 
0	while the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible anne rice novel it's based upon , queen of the damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle . 
0	it should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring . 
0	a good-looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance . 
0	a tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid . 
0	if hill isn't quite his generation's don siegel ( or robert aldrich ) , it's because there's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; it's all bluster and cliché . 
0	stealing harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : a few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious . 
0	this is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors . 
0	does anyone much think the central story of brendan behan is that he was a bisexual sweetheart before he took to drink ? 
0	`martin lawrence live' is so self-pitying , i almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show . 
0	the dialogue is cumbersome , the simpering soundtrack and editing more so . 
0	never decides whether it wants to be a black comedy , drama , melodrama or some combination of the three . 
0	it has become apparent that the franchise's best years are long past . 
0	does what should seem impossible : it makes serial killer jeffrey dahmer boring . 
0	don't hate el crimen del padre amaro because it's anti-catholic . hate it because it's lousy . 
0	 . . . better described as a ghost story gone badly awry . 
0	like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they're struggling to create . 
0	the filmmakers are playing to the big boys in new york and l . a . to that end , they mock the kind of folks they don't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers don't care to understand , either . 
0	competently directed but terminally cute drama . 
0	the big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing . 
0	not just unlikable . disturbing . disgusting . without any redeeming value whatsoever . 
0	this thing is virtually unwatchable . 
0	those eternally devoted to the insanity of black will have an intermittently good time . feel free to go get popcorn whenever he's not onscreen . 
0	the self-serious equilibrium makes its point too well ; a movie , like life , isn't much fun without the highs and lows . 
0	the work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who can't get out of his own way . 
0	the main characters are simply named the husband , the wife and the kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort . 
0	in terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused . 
0	swims in mediocrity , sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then . 
0	the only type of lives this glossy comedy-drama resembles are ones in formulaic mainstream movies . 
0	the characters . . . are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script . 
0	a sha-na-na sketch punctuated with graphic violence . 
0	the trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through . 
0	spy-vs . -spy action flick with antonio banderas and lucy liu never comes together . 
0	a so-so , made-for-tv something posing as a real movie . 
0	the only upside to all of this unpleasantness is , given its labor day weekend upload , feardotcom should log a minimal number of hits . 
0	whether this is art imitating life or life imitating art , it's an unhappy situation all around . 
0	an uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection . 
0	a formula family tearjerker told with a heavy irish brogue . . . accentuating , rather than muting , the plot's saccharine thrust . 
0	this is sandler running on empty , repeating what he's already done way too often . 
0	this is as lax and limp a comedy as i've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material . 
0	time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool " clockstoppers , " but that doesn't mean it still won't feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life . 
0	the sort of picture in which , whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do , they go to a picture-perfect beach during sunset . 
0	aptly named , this shimmering , beautifully costumed and filmed production doesn't work for me . 
0	a preposterously melodramatic paean to gang-member teens in brooklyn circa 1958 . 
0	has none of the crackle of " fatal attraction " , " 9 ½ weeks " , or even " indecent proposal " , and feels more like lyne's stolid remake of " lolita " . 
0	everything its title implies , a standard-issue crime drama spat out from the tinseltown assembly line . 
0	an extraordinarily silly thriller . 
0	a rehash of every gangster movie from the past decade . 
0	gaping plot holes sink this 'sub'-standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth . 
0	talkiness isn't necessarily bad , but the dialogue frequently misses the mark . 
0	the beautiful images and solemn words cannot disguise the slack complacency of [godard's] vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice . 
0	the stunt work is top-notch ; the dialogue and drama often food-spittingly funny . 
0	the movie isn't painfully bad , something to be 'fully experienced' ; it's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten . 
0	charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past love story derisions . 
0	what a great shame that such a talented director as chen kaige has chosen to make his english-language debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted . 
0	no amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story . 
0	the film . . . presents classic moral-condundrum drama : what would you have done to survive ? the problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of auschwitz ii-birkenau . 
0	 . . . for all its social and political potential , state property doesn't end up being very inspiring or insightful . 
0	a film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this isn't . 
0	little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point . . . is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable . 
0	the nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations . 
0	this is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy . 
0	this off-putting french romantic comedy is sure to test severely the indulgence of fans of amélie . 
0	overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue
0	ensemble movies , like soap operas , depend on empathy . if there ain't none , you have a problem . 
0	the master of disguise falls under the category of 'should have been a sketch on saturday night live . '
0	yet another self-consciously overwritten story about a rag-tag bunch of would-be characters that team up for a can't-miss heist -- only to have it all go wrong . 
0	koepp's screenplay isn't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own . 
0	is it really an advantage to invest such subtlety and warmth in an animatronic bear when the humans are acting like puppets ? 
0	more successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex , dramatically satisfying heroine
0	clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades . 
0	it's hard to pity the 'plain' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss . rather , pity anyone who sees this mishmash . 
0	a banal , virulently unpleasant excuse for a romantic comedy . 
0	the drama discloses almost nothing . 
0	a minor-league soccer remake of the longest yard . 
0	belongs in the too-hot-for-tv direct-to-video/dvd category , and this is why i have given it a one-star rating . 
0	as earnest as a community-college advertisement , american chai is enough to make you put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school . 
0	a dim-witted and lazy spin-off of the animal planet documentary series , crocodile hunter is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring . 
0	there is more than one joke about putting the toilet seat down . and that should tell you everything you need to know about all the queen's men . 
0	even fans of ismail merchant's work , i suspect , would have a hard time sitting through this one . 
0	it's really just another silly hollywood action film , one among a multitude of simple-minded , yahoo-ing death shows . 
0	it's not a particularly good film , but neither is it a monsterous one . 
0	the world needs more filmmakers with passionate enthusiasms like martin scorsese . but it doesn't need gangs of new york . 
0	enchanted with low-life tragedy and liberally seasoned with emotional outbursts . . . what is sorely missing , however , is the edge of wild , lunatic invention that we associate with cage's best acting . 
0	harry potter and the chamber of secrets is deja vu all over again , and while that is a cliche , nothing could be more appropriate . it's likely that whatever you thought of the first production -- pro or con -- you'll likely think of this one . 
0	sade achieves the near-impossible : it turns the marquis de sade into a dullard . 
0	[lin chung's] voice is rather unexceptional , even irritating ( at least to this western ear ) , making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters . 
0	one of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies i've ever seen . 
0	though there's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish . 
0	unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making .

0	harris is supposed to be the star of the story , but comes across as pretty dull and wooden . 
0	soulless and -- even more damning -- virtually joyless , xxx achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence . 
0	a boring masquerade ball where normally good actors , even kingsley , are made to look bad . 
0	all the queen's men is a throwback war movie that fails on so many levels , it should pay reparations to viewers . 
0	the filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart . 
0	rather than real figures , elling and kjell bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the naïf's encounter with the world . 
0	mariah carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in glitter here in wisegirls . 
0	it's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it's all about the silences and if you're into that , have at it .

0	the movie doesn't generate a lot of energy . it is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously . 
0	this feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head
0	the cinematic equivalent of patronizing a bar favored by pretentious , untalented artistes who enjoy moaning about their cruel fate . 
0	spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen , not screaming but yawning . 
0	it feels like very light errol morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs .

0	the premise itself is just sooooo tired . pair that with really poor comedic writing . . . and you've got a huge mess . 
0	proves a lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness . 
0	did we really need a remake of " charade ? " 
0	some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff . stealing harvard can't even do that much . each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth . 
0	the only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game . you try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored . 
0	i spied with my little eye . . . a mediocre collection of cookie-cutter action scenes and occasionally inspired dialogue bits

0	an awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers . 
0	the story is far-flung , illogical , and plain stupid . 
0	the very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary . 
0	an allegory concerning the chronically mixed signals african american professionals get about overachieving could be intriguing , but the supernatural trappings only obscure the message .

0	one key problem with these ardently christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out .

0	a relentless , bombastic and ultimately empty world war ii action flick .

0	any film that doesn't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss . 
0	 . . . blade ii is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves . 
0	the rules of attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing .

0	no surprises . 
0	you have once again entered the bizarre realm where director adrian lyne holds sway , where all relationships are simultaneously broadly metaphorical , oddly abstract , and excruciatingly literal . 
0	the high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : there's very little hustling on view . 
0	this director's cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera . 
0	characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle . 
0	the venezuelans say things like " si , pretty much " and " por favor , go home " when talking to americans . that's muy loco , but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of " dragonfly . " 
0	it's a movie that ends with truckzilla , for cryin' out loud . if that doesn't clue you in that something's horribly wrong , nothing will . 
0	director tom shadyac and star kevin costner glumly mishandle the story's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself .

0	like the tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on
0	as pedestrian as they come . 
0	a film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen .

0	you come away thinking not only that kate isn't very bright , but that she hasn't been worth caring about and that maybe she , janine and molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another . 
0	the metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery . 
0	very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all . 
0	too much power , not enough puff . 
0	the attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show . 
0	it's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by taylor's cartoonish performance and the film's ill-considered notion that hitler's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances . 
0	a cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic ladies and gentlemen , the fabulous stains . . . crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential . 
0	muddled , trashy and incompetent
0	for this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull sorvino has no light touch , and rodan is out of his league .

0	despite juliet stevenon's attempt to bring cohesion to pamela's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs . 
0	it's tough to be startled when you're almost dozing . 
0	his [nelson's] screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it . 
0	it's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead . 
0	a terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving . 
0	there are many definitions of 'time waster' but this movie must surely be one of them . 
0	as it stands , crocodile hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 godzilla , which combined scenes of a japanese monster flick with canned shots of raymond burr commenting on the monster's path of destruction . 
0	the thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie . 
0	enigma is well-made , but it's just too dry and too placid .
