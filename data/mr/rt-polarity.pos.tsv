1	if you can get past the taboo subject matter , it will be well worth your time .

1	a compelling pre-wwii drama with vivid characters and a warm , moving message . 
1	the stars may be college kids , but the subject matter is as adult as you can get : the temptations of the flesh are unleashed by a slightly crazed , overtly determined young woman and a one-night swim turns into an ocean of trouble . 
1	pretty good little movie . 
1	by turns touching , raucously amusing , uncomfortable , and , yes , even sexy , never again is a welcome and heartwarming addition to the romantic comedy genre . 
1	worse than 'silence of the lambs' better than 'hannibal'
1	if you haven't seen the film lately , you may be surprised at the variety of tones in spielberg's work . much of it is funny , but there are also some startling , surrealistic moments . . . 
1	[the digital effects] reminded me of terry gilliam's rudimentary old monty python cartoons , in which he would cut out figures from drawings and photographs and paste them together . 
1	an entertaining mix of period drama and flat-out farce that should please history fans . 
1	canada's arctic light shines bright on this frozen tundra soap opera that breathes extraordinary life into the private existence of the inuit people . 
1	the fluid motion is astounding on any number of levels -- including the physical demands made on büttner -- and it implies in its wake the intractable , irreversible flow of history .

1	insanely hilarious ! i haven't laughed that hard in years ! 
1	anyone who's ever suffered under a martinet music instructor has no doubt fantasized about what an unhappy , repressed and twisted personal life their tormentor deserved . these people are really going to love the piano teacher . 
1	it's a tour de force , written and directed so quietly that it's implosion rather than explosion you fear . 
1	it may not be history  but then again , what if it is ?  but it makes for one of the most purely enjoyable and satisfying evenings at the movies i've had in a while . 
1	if " lilo & stitch " isn't the most edgy piece of disney animation to hit the silver screen , then this first film to use a watercolor background since " dumbo " certainly ranks as the most original in years . 
1	this may be dover kosashvili's feature directing debut , but it looks an awful lot like life -- gritty , awkward and ironic . 
1	this ready-made midnight movie probably won't stand the cold light of day , but under the right conditions , it's goofy ( if not entirely wholesome ) fun . 
1	see scratch for the history , see scratch for the music , see scratch for a lesson in scratching , but , most of all , see it for the passion . 
1	 . . . " bowling for columbine " remains a disquieting and thought-provoking film . . . 
1	even though it is infused with the sensibility of a video director , it doesn't make for completely empty entertainment
1	but even with the two-wrongs-make-a-right chemistry between jolie and burns . . . this otherwise appealing picture loses its soul to screenwriting for dummies conformity . 
1	talk to her is so darned assured , we have absolutely no idea who the main characters are until the film is well under way -- and yet it's hard to stop watching . 
1	star/producer salma hayek and director julie taymor have infused frida with a visual style unique and inherent to the titular character's paintings and in the process created a masterful work of art of their own .

1	a low-key labor of love that strikes a very resonant chord . 
1	an average kid-empowerment fantasy with slightly above-average brains . 
1	confessions isn't always coherent , but it's sharply comic and surprisingly touching , so hold the gong . 
1	while guzmán frustratingly refuses to give pinochet's crimes a political context , his distance from the material is mostly admirable .

1	a sentimental but entirely irresistible portrait of three aging sisters . 
1	white oleander may leave you rolling your eyes in the dark , but that doesn't mean you won't like looking at it . 
1	in painting an unabashedly romantic picture of a nation whose songs spring directly from the lives of the people , the movie exalts the marxian dream of honest working folk , with little to show for their labor , living harmoniously , joined in song . 
1	the most brilliant work in this genre since the 1984 uncut version of sergio leone's flawed but staggering once upon a time in america . 
1	it looks closely , insightfully at fragile , complex relationships . 
1	not a bad choice here , assuming that . . . the air-conditioning in the theater is working properly . 
1	a fine effort , an interesting topic , some intriguing characters and a sad ending . certainly the big finish wasn't something galinsky and hawley could have planned for . . . but part of being a good documentarian is being there when the rope snaps . 
1	it must be the end of the world : the best film so far this year is a franchise sequel starring wesley snipes .

1	refreshing . 
1	a hypnotic portrait of this sad , compulsive life . 
1	[while the last metro] was more melodramatic , confined to a single theater company and its strategies and deceptions , while tavernier is more concerned with the entire period of history .

1	murderous maids pulls no punches in its depiction of the lives of the papin sister and the events that led to their notorious rise to infamy . . . 
1	this is an undeniably intriguing film from an adventurous young talent who finds his inspiration on the fringes of the american underground . 
1	the sweetest thing , a romantic comedy with outrageous tendencies , may be a mess in a lot of ways . but it does have one saving grace . a lot of its gags and observations reflect a woman's point-of-view . 
1	this is lightweight filmmaking , to be sure , but it's pleasant enough -- and oozing with attractive men . 
1	at its most basic , this cartoon adventure is that wind-in-the-hair exhilarating . 
1	fans of critics' darling band wilco will marvel at the sometimes murky , always brooding look of i am trying to break your heart .

1	it's a cool event for the whole family . maybe not a classic , but a movie the kids will want to see over and over again . 
1	featherweight romantic comedy has a few nice twists in a standard plot and the charisma of hugh grant and sandra bullock . 
1	the movie is not as terrible as the synergistic impulse that created it . 
1	a typically observant , carefully nuanced and intimate french coming-of-age film that is an encouraging debut feature but has a needlessly downbeat ending that is too heavy for all that has preceded it . 
1	less an examination of neo-nazism than a probe into the nature of faith itself . 
1	a moving and weighty depiction of one family's attempts to heal after the death of a child . 
1	i don't think most of the people who loved the 1989 paradiso will prefer this new version . but i do . 
1	a zinger-filled crowd-pleaser that open-minded elvis fans ( but by no means all ) will have fun with . 
1	diggs and lathan are among the chief reasons brown sugar is such a sweet and sexy film . 
1	entirely suspenseful , extremely well-paced and ultimately . . . dare i say , entertaining ! 
1	the riveting performances by the incredibly flexible cast make love a joy to behold . 
1	terrific as nadia , a russian mail-order bride who comes to america speaking not a word of english , it's kidman who holds the film together with a supremely kittenish performance that gradually accumulates more layers . 
1	with an unflappable air of decadent urbanity , everett remains a perfect wildean actor , and a relaxed firth displays impeccable comic skill . 
1	the re-release of ron howard's apollo 13 in the imax format proves absolutely that really , really , really good things can come in enormous packages . 
1	very well written and directed with brutal honesty and respect for its audience . 
1	wonderful fencing scenes and an exciting plot make this an eminently engrossing film . 
1	it's pretty linear and only makeup-deep , but bogdanovich ties it together with efficiency and an affection for the period .

1	a haunting tale of murder and mayhem . 
1	i love the opening scenes of a wintry new york city in 1899 . cinematic poetry showcases the city's old-world charm before machines change nearly everything . 
1	it's hard to imagine anyone managing to steal a movie not only from charismatic rising star jake gyllenhaal but also from accomplished oscar winners susan sarandon , dustin hoffman and holly hunter , yet newcomer ellen pompeo pulls off the feat with aplomb . 
1	one of the best rock documentaries ever . wilco is a phenomenal band with such an engrossing story that will capture the minds and hearts of many .

1	a tremendous piece of work . 
1	a delightful , if minor , pastry of a movie . 
1	while obviously aimed at kids , the country bears . . . should keep parents amused with its low groan-to-guffaw ratio . 
1	labute masterfully balances both traditional or modern stories together in a manner that one never overwhelms the other . something for everyone . 
1	irwin is so earnest that it's hard to resist his pleas to spare wildlife and respect their environs . there are far worse messages to teach a young audience , which will probably be perfectly happy with the sloppy slapstick comedy . 
1	leigh succeeds in delivering a dramatic slap in the face that's simultaneously painful and refreshing . 
1	not about scares but a mood in which an ominous , pervasive , and unknown threat lurks just below the proceedings and adds an almost constant mindset of suspense . 
1	'film aficionados cannot help but love cinema paradiso , whether the original version or new director's cut . '
1	a fascinating glimpse into an insular world that gives the lie to many clichés and showcases a group of dedicated artists . 
1	it's one thing to read about or rail against the ongoing - and unprecedented - construction project going on over our heads . it's quite another to feel physically caught up in the process . 
1	contradicts everything we've come to expect from movies nowadays . instead of simply handling conventional material in a conventional way , secretary takes the most unexpected material and handles it in the most unexpected way . 
1	could i have been more geeked when i heard that apollo 13 was going to be released in imax format ? in a word : no . 
1	murderous maids has a lot going for it , not least the brilliant performances by testud . . . and parmentier . 
1	filmmaker stacy peralta has a flashy editing style that doesn't always jell with sean penn's monotone narration , but he respects the material without sentimentalizing it . 
1	there are a couple of things that elevate " glory " above most of its ilk , most notably the mere presence of duvall . 
1	it's light on the chills and heavy on the atmospheric weirdness , and there are moments of jaw-droppingly odd behavior -- yet i found it weirdly appealing .

1	leaping from one arresting image to another , songs from the second floor has all the enjoyable randomness of a very lively dream and so manages to be compelling , amusing and unsettling at the same time . 
1	sean penn , you owe nicolas cage an apology . 
1	the performances are uniformly good . 
1	she's all-powerful , a voice for a pop-cyber culture that feeds on her bjorkness . 
1	it's a perfect show of respect to just one of those underrated professionals who deserve but rarely receive it . 
1	for all its plot twists , and some of them verge on the bizarre as the film winds down , blood work is a strong , character-oriented piece . 
1	the story line may be 127 years old , but el crimen del padre amaro . . . couldn't be more timely in its despairing vision of corruption within the catholic establishment .

1	brings awareness to an issue often overlooked -- women's depression . 
1	it's a shame the marvelous first 101 minutes have to be combined with the misconceived final 5 . 
1	it has a caffeinated , sloppy brilliance , sparkling with ideas you wish had been developed with more care , but animated by an energy that puts the dutiful efforts of more disciplined grade-grubbers to shame . 
1	you can almost see mendes and company getting together before a single frame had been shot and collectively vowing , 'this is going to be something really good . ' and it is .

1	a playful iranian parable about openness , particularly the need for people of diverse political perspectives to get along despite their ideological differences . 
1	brilliantly written and well-acted , yellow asphalt is an uncompromising film . 
1	that 'alabama' manages to be pleasant in spite of its predictability and occasional slowness is due primarily to the perkiness of witherspoon ( who is always a joy to watch , even when her material is not first-rate ) . . . 
1	personal velocity has a no-frills docu-dogma plainness , yet miller lingers on invisible , nearly psychic nuances , leaping into digressions of memory and desire . she boxes these women's souls right open for us .

1	genuinely unnerving . 
1	american and european cinema has amassed a vast holocaust literature , but it is impossible to think of any film more challenging or depressing than the grey zone . 
1	a compelling film . 
1	with its hint of an awkward hitchcockian theme in tact , harmon's daunting narrative promotes a reasonable landscape of conflict and pathos to support the scattershot terrorizing tone
1	in auteil's less dramatic but equally incisive performance , he's a charismatic charmer likely to seduce and conquer . 
1	the heart of the film is a touching reflection on aging , suffering and the prospect of death . 
1	will you go ape over this movie ? well , it probably won't have you swinging from the trees hooting it's praises , but it's definitely worth taking a look . 
1	its director's most substantial feature for some time . 
1	fontaine's direction , especially her agreeably startling use of close-ups and her grace with a moving camera , creates sheerly cinematic appeal . 
1	the son of the bride's humour is born out of an engaging storyline , which also isn't embarrassed to make you reach for the tissues . this movie is to be cherished .

1	the story's scope and pageantry are mesmerizing , and mr . day-lewis roars with leonine power . 
1	p . t . anderson understands the grandness of romance and how love is the great equalizer that can calm us of our daily ills and bring out joys in our lives that we never knew were possible . 
1	twenty years later , e . t . is still a cinematic touchstone . 
1	this fascinating experiment plays as more of a poetic than a strict reality , creating an intriguing species of artifice that gives the lady and the duke something of a theatrical air . 
1	it's virtually impossible to like any of these despicable characters . 
1	this is mostly well-constructed fluff , which is all it seems intended to be . 
1	even through its flaws , revolution #9 proves to be a compelling , interestingly told film .

1	schepisi , aided by a cast that seems to include every top-notch british actor who did not appear in gosford park ( as well as one , ms . mirren , who did ) , has succeeded beyond all expectation . 
1	lejos del paraíso es al mismo tiempo una fiesta para los ojos y oídos y un movilizador cuadro de personajes enfrentados a sus propios deseos , miedos y prejuicios . 
1	watching this film , one is left with the inescapable conclusion that hitchens' obsession with kissinger is , at bottom , a sophisticated flower child's desire to purge the world of the tooth and claw of human power . 
1	there is no denying the power of polanski's film . . . 
1	the movie is amateurish , but it's a minor treat .

1	astonishing . . . [frames] profound ethical and philosophical questions in the form of dazzling pop entertainment . 
1	take care is nicely performed by a quintet of actresses , but nonetheless it drags during its 112-minute length . 
1	it's hard to fairly judge a film like ringu when you've seen the remake first . many of the effective horror elements are dampened through familiarity , [yet] are worthwhile .
