# Text classification

Implementation for Some pupular machine learning algorithms for text classification.
This project is partly based castorini's work on https://github.com/castorini/Castor. 

## Model Type

- rand: All words are randomly initialized and then modified during training.
- static: A model with pre-trained vectors from [word2vec](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/). All words -- including the unknown ones that are initialized with zero -- are kept static and only the other parameters of the model are learned.
- non-static: Same as above but the pretrained vectors are fine-tuned for each task.
- multichannel: A model with two sets of word vectors. Each set of vectors is treated as a 'channel' and each filter is applied to both channels, but gradients are back-propagated only through one of the channels. Hence the model is able to fine-tune one set of vectors while keeping the other static. Both channels are initialized with word2vec.# text-classification-cnn
